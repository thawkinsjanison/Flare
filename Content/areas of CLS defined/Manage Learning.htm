        <p>In this area of the system you can create and manage learning assets of many types.  Aspects of learning such as enrolling, marking, approving and endorsing can be managed here.  Competencies and continued professional development (CPD) can be created and linked to learning assets and learners.  A powerful reporting facility exists to report on most data in the system.</p>
