        <h5>Edit in Wizard</h5>
        <p>Add Learning wizard is a setup assistant that offers a series of dialog boxes to complete the steps required to create a learning asset in the CLS and then link it to a new Catalogue Item. See Add Learning for details</p>
        <p>Manage Catalogues offers a link to part of the way through this wizard, so that the Catalogue Item created is the one you start with here (rather than a brand new one) but you are otherwise assisted with all the steps to set it up, including adding Learning Assets, Tags and Competencies.</p>
        <p>To edit a Catalogue Item in the wizard select Manage Learning &gt; Manage Catalogue</p>
        <ul>
            <li>click the desired Catalogue Item</li>
            <li>select Edit in Wizard from the Actions drop-down box </li>
        </ul>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>The next screen displayed is Step 2 of the 4 steps in the Add Learning wizard. Complete the wizard as usual. See Add Learning for details.</p>
