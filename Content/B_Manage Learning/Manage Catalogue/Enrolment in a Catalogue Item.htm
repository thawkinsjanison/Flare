        <h5>Enrolment in a Catalogue Item</h5>
        <p>There are a number of ways that User enrolment in a Catalogue Item can take place. Broadly speaking, Catalogue Items can be configured so that learner Users are enrolled by authorised Users (such as trainers or administrators) or so that learner Users can enrol themselves. </p>
        <p>To create User enrolments in Catalogue Items:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">You can use the setup wizard Assign Learning</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">You can enrol Users in a Catalogue Item through Manage Catalogues. This technique brings you to the Enrolments section with that Catalogue Item, see Assign Learning â€“ Catalogue Item.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">You can import upload a spreadsheet of Enrolment data containing lists of Catalogue Items, Users, Status, etc. See Import Learning History</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">You can create and run User Enrolment Rules where you select specific Users and automatically enrol them in specific Catalogue Items, see User Enrolment Rules </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Learner Users can enrol themselves in Catalogue Items depending on the Self Enrolment Settings. These specify:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">whether User self-enrolment is possible at all</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">the default enrolment method for all Catalogue Items</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">whether the default method can be overridden for an individual Catalogue Item, and </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">the range of enrolment methods possible for that Catalogue Item</li>
        </ul>
        <p>See Settings &gt; Self enrolment for more details of setting this up. </p>
        <p>See Enrolments for more general information about managing enrolments once they have been created.</p>
