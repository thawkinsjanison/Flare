        <h5>Inspect Catalogue Item</h5>
        <p>Inspecting a Catalogue Item gives you access to important information about it and allows you to edit some of this. The screen also offers the opportunity to edit more details about the Catalogue Item via selecting Edit Catalogue Item from the Actions drop-down menu, see <a href="Edit in Wizard.htm#_Edit_Catalogue_Item"><span class="Hyperlink">Edit Catalogue Item</span></a></p>
        <p>To inspect a Catalogue Item select Manage Learning &gt; Manage Catalogue and click the desired Catalogue Item. The inspection screen is then displayed.</p>
        <ol start="1">
            <li>Click Tasks and Notes to update them if desired and click Attachments to upload an Attachment</li>
            <li>Data about enrolled Users is displayed:</li>
        </ol>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li>Enrolled Users in the Catalogue Item</li>
            <li>Users who have Not Attempted the Catalogue Item</li>
            <li>Users who have not completed the Catalogue Item (Incomplete) </li>
            <li>Users who have Completed the Catalogue Item</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each piece of data is a link to the Enrolments section of the CLS where the appropriate selection of Enrolments in the Catalogue Item will be listed. If desired these can subsequently be modified (see Enrolment&gt;View More about an Enrolment)</p>
        <ol start="3">
            <li>The status of the Catalogue Item. Click Change to change it.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Make Private removes the item from the catalogue, i.e. hides it from learners although they can still be enrolled in it. Make Public adds the item to the catalogue, i.e. makes it active and visible to learners. Archiving the item takes it out of activity altogether</p>
        <ol start="4">
            <li>The Learning assets linked to this Catalogue Item are listed in this screen. The list can be edited in Edit Catalogue Item</li>
