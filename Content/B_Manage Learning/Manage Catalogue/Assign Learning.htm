        <h5>Assign Learning</h5>
        <p>Assign Learning is a wizard, i.e. a setup assistant, which offers authorised Users a series of dialog boxes to complete the steps required to enrol Users in Catalogue Item(s) and schedule the enrolment process. It is available through Manage Learning &gt; Assign Learning</p>
        <p>Manage Catalogues provides a separate link to this wizard through a Catalogue Item. The wizard starts off with that Catalogue Item selected as part of the Content that User(s) enrol in. </p>

            <li>Select Manage Learning &gt; Manage Catalogue </li>
            <li>Click the desired Catalogue Item </li>
            <li>Select Assign Learning from the Actions drop-down menu. </li>
