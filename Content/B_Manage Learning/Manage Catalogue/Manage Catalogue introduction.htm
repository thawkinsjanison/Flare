        <h5>Manage Catalogue- introduction</h5>
        <p>The CLS makes a number of Learning Assets available to learner Users, such as Courses, Tests, Discussion Groups, SCORM courses, face to face events and external websites. See Manage Learning Assets for more details. A User cannot enrol/be enrolled in these directly, but instead enrols in Catalogue Items that are linked to these Learning Assets. Thus, a Catalogue Item is an enrollable container: a collection of rules and a linked Learning Asset. </p>
        <p>Note that a Catalogue Item contains only one Learning Asset and its associated icon indicates what that Learning Asset is. However you can link it to more than one Learning Asset when it is created or when it is subsequently edited. In these cases it remains functionally the same but becomes known as a Program. If the change occurs as a result of editing a Catalogue Item, you will notice its icon changes from that of its linked Learning Asset (e.g. a Janison Course) to that of a Program:</p>

            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Manage Catalogue/Manage Catalogue introduction.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>Thus, in this document any further references to Catalogue Items also include Programs as well. </p>
        <p>Catalogue Items can be configured so that Users are enrolled by authorised Users (such as trainers or administrators) or so that Users can self-enrol. See <a href="Enrolment in a Catalogue Item.htm#_Enrolment_in_a"><span class="Hyperlink">Enrolment in a Catalogue Item</span></a> for more details about this and see Enrolments for more general information about managing enrolments.</p>
        <p>Note that Catalogue Access Rules allow you to setup specific rules relating to which Catalogue Items that learner Users can see and enrol in. See Settings &gt; Catalogue Access Setting</p>
        <p>Tags or keywords can be attached to Catalogue Items so that Catalogue Items can be categorised and searched for in the CLS. You can also link Competencies to Catalogue Items. On successful completion of the Catalogue Item, learners will be automatically awarded the attached Competencies. Catalogue items are also used in association with Continuing Professional Development (CPD).</p>
        <p>Manage Catalogue is the place in the CLS where authorised Users can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>create a Catalogue Item and link it to Learning Asset(s), Competencies, a Certificate, etc</li>
            <li>search for, inspect, edit and archive current Catalogue Items and study their User Enrolments</li>
            <li>import Catalogue Item Tags</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This section also contains links to the Add Learning wizard, a setup assistant that offers a series of steps to create a new Learning Asset in the CLS and then link it to a new Catalogue Item so Users can enrol in it. See Add Learning</p>
        <p>Catalogue management can be reached by selecting Manage Learning &gt; Manage Catalogue. </p>
