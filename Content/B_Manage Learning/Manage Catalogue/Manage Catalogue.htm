        <h5>Manage Catalogue</h5>
        <p>Catalogue management is reached by selecting Manage Learning &gt; Manage Catalogue. The screen displays all Catalogue Items. This list can be filtered by the Search function (see <a href="Edit in Wizard.htm#_Search_for_a"><span class="Hyperlink">Search for a Catalogue Item</span></a>) </p>
        <p>The Catalogue Items are divided into the following tabs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Available in Catalogue - the Catalogue Item is Public - students can see it in Browse Learning (and also self-enrol if that’s enabled)</li>
            <li>Not in Catalogue – the Catalogue Item is Private and students can’t see it in Browse Learning (but they can be enrolled in it by an authorised User)</li>
            <li>Draft - the Catalogue Item is incomplete – e.g. the Add learning wizard was started but not completed</li>
            <li>Archived - the Catalogue Item has been Archived and is unavailable for all kinds of enrolments</li>
            <li>All</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Click the tabs to see the items in each category.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Manage Catalogue/Manage Catalogue.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>On this screen you can view the creation date for each Catalogue Item. The number under Number of Enrolments is also a link that takes you to the Enrolments section of the CLS with a list of all the enrolments for that Catalogue Item. You can also continue from this point to add new User enrolments to the Catalogue Item.</p>
        <p>Note that the icons displayed under the Type heading indicate the type of Learning Asset contained in each Catalogue item, see Types of Learning Asset. Where there is more than one Learning Asset, the Catalogue Item is technically a Program and displays the icon for a Program.</p>
