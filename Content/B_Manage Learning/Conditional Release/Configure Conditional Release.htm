        <h1>Configure Conditional Release</h1>
        <p>Conditional Release is applied within a program and directly to the components which they effect. Before you set up Conditional Release of program components, remember:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Conditional Release cannot be applied to the following learning assets.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Assessment Events</li>
                <li>Booked Assessment Events</li>
                <li>Learning Events</li>
                <li>Plans</li>
                <li>Subscriptions</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Setting up Conditional Release on a program which already has active enrolments will not affect those enrolments.</li>
            <li>Conditional Release cannot be set on components with Share Progress selected.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Setup</h2>
        <p>Browse to Manage Learning &gt; Manage Catalogue.</p>

        </p>
        <p>From here, you can either choose to configure Conditional Release on an existing Catalogue Item by editing it or on a new Catalogue Item. For this tutorial, we will be creating a new Catalogue Item.</p>
        <ol start="1">
            <li>Select Add Catalogue Item.</li>
        </ol>
        <p> <img src="../../Resources/Images/Conditional Release_imp/Configure Conditional Release_1.png" /></p>
        <ol start="2">
            <li>Enter a Name and Identifier.</li>
        </ol>
        <p> <img src="../../Resources/Images/Conditional Release_imp/Configure Conditional Release_2.png" /></p>
        <ol start="3">
            <li>In the Components section, Select Learning Asset and Add Component.</li>
        </ol>
        <p> <img src="../../Resources/Images/Conditional Release_imp/Configure Conditional Release_3.png" /></p>
        <p>Make sure to add at least two component to enable Conditional Release.</p>
        <div class="spnote">
            <ul>
                <li style="list-style-image: url('../../Resources/Images/Conditional Release_imp/condred.png');">Indicates that Conditional Release is not available on this component. Selecting the icon will provide details as to why.</li>
                <li style="list-style-image: url('../../Resources/Images/Conditional Release_imp/condyel.png');">Indicates that Conditional Release is available for this component but has not been set.</li>
                <li style="list-style-image: url('../../Resources/Images/Conditional Release_imp/condgre.png');">Indicates that Conditional Release has been set for this component.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <ol start="4">
            <li>Select <img src="../../Resources/Images/Conditional Release_imp/Configure Conditional Release_4.png" style="border: none" /> to set the Conditional Release on this component.</li>
        </ol>
        <p> <img src="../../Resources/Images/Conditional Release_imp/Configure Conditional Release_5.png" /></p>
        <p>A dialogue box will appear with several options which allow you to set the Conditional Release of a Component.</p>
        <ol start="1">
            <li>Release Date options allow you to set the time on which the component becomes available for use.</li>
            <ol start="1">
                <li>This option does not set a Conditional Release rule. The component will be available on enrolment.</li>
                <li>This option releases the component on the specified number of days, weeks or months after the enrolment is received.</li>
                <li>This option releases the component on the specified day of the year after the enrolment is received. </li>
            </ol>
            <li>Lock Date options allow you to set the time on which the component becomes locked from use.</li>
            <ol start="1">
                <li>This option does not set a Conditional Lock rule. The component will always be available after release.</li>
                <li>This option locks the component on the specified number of days, weeks or months after the enrolment is received.</li>
                <li>This option locks the component on the specified day of the year after the enrolment is received.</li>
            </ol>
            <li value="5">Select Save to complete the action.</li>
        </ol>

        </div>
        <p class="spnote">The Lock Date settings react to the Release Date settings. If a Release date is set the Lock Date rules change from ‘after enrolment’ to ‘after release’.</p>
        <ol start="6">

        </ol>

        <p class="spnote">You can edit Conditional Release on components by selecting <img src="../../Resources/Images/Conditional Release_imp/Configure Conditional Release_8.png" style="border: none;" /> while editing the catalogue item.</p>
