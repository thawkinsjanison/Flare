        <h1>Conditional Release</h1>
        <p>You can use Conditional Release to set time or date based periods during which a program component is active for use. There are two ways to set Conditional Release.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can set a time for when a component will be made active within a program enrolment.</li>
            <li>You can set a time for when a component will be made inactive within a program enrolment.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Learners can see the details of both but cannot access inactive content.</p>
        <p>Conditional Release also works with <a href="../Manage Catalogue1/Prerequisites within Programs.htm">Prerequisites</a>. An asset does not become available to a learner unless both the prerequisites are met and the asset is available for use under Conditional Release rules.</p>
        <h2>Initial Settings</h2>
        <p>To enable Conditional Release, browse to <b>Settings</b> &gt; <b>Catalogue Item Settings</b>.</p>
