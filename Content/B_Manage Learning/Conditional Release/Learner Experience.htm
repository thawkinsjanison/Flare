        <h1>Learner Experience</h1>
        <p>When a learner finds a program with Conditional Release applied they will be able to see the conditions applied to the component from the enrolment screen. Each component will list the period in which the learner can gain access.</p>
        <img src="../../Resources/Images/Conditional Release_imp/Learner Experience.png" />
        <p>After a learner is enrolled into a program, those assets not yet released or those assets locked are unavailable to the learner and is shown by dimming the Launch button.</p>
        <img src="../../Resources/Images/Conditional Release_imp/Learner Experience_1.png" />
        <p>When an asset is within the Conditional Release period then it becomes active and the learner is able to launch the component. If there is a Conditional Lock on the component, a message will display on the asset which shows how long the asset is available for.</p>
