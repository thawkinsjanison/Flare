        <h1 class="Heading1">Marking – introduction</h1>
        <p>A large amount of Learning and Assessment Test marking is done automatically in the CLS, based on the specifications set for the Questions (correct answers, etc) and Test (pass marks, etc). The Marking section of the CLS displays the results of automatically marked Test Attempts and makes it possible to inspect, re-mark and edit those results if desired.</p>
        <p>However, certain types of Learning Assets must be marked manually. Examples are:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Face-to-face training in Learning Event Sessions</li>
            <p>Learning Event Sessions are marked as part of Managing Sessions, see <a href="../../B_Manage Learning/Manage Sessions2/Mark a Session.htm">Mark a Session</a>.</p>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">File-based submissions, i.e. Assignments</li>
            <p>Assignments are marked as part of Assignment Submission, see <a href="../../B_Manage Learning/Assignment/Assignment introduction.htm">Assignments</a>.</p>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Manually marked Test Attempts</li>
            <p>These are marked in the <strong>Marking</strong> section and the process is described in this document. </p>
            <p>As with automatically marked Test attempts, the Marking section also displays the results of these marked Test Attempts and makes it possible to inspect, re-mark and edit them if desired.</p>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Marking/Marking introduction.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square; border-style: none;" />
        </p>
        <p>Tests can have the following marking options:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
            <li><strong>Automatic</strong>: the CLS does the marking.</li>
            <li><strong>Manual</strong>: a marker must do the marking.</li>
            <li><strong>Mixed</strong>: partly automatically marked and partly manually marked.</li>
            <li><strong>Do not mark</strong>: the Test is non assessable and will not be marked.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The Test Attempts in categories 2 and 3 are those from:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Learning Module Tests containing Short Answer questions, </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Assessment Module Tests containing Short Answer(s) and/or File Upload questions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When learners submit these kinds of Test Attempts, the appropriate Marker is notified by email if notifications are enabled. When the Marker logs into the system the Test Attempts to be marked are displayed and can be marked. After marking their status is set to completed. They can subsequently be inspected and re-marked if desired.</p>
        <p>Note that an Assessment Event, that is an Assessment Test that takes place at a specific time and place, requires an additional role, that of Chief Marker. This person is in-charge of overseeing the marking and scoring of candidate responses for this specific Test paper and the creation of the Test marking project.</p>
        <p>Marking is managed by selecting <strong>Manage Learning &gt; Marking</strong>.</p>
