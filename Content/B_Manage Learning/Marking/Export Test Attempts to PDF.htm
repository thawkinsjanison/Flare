        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li style="list-style-type: square;">The next step is to specify which of the Test Attempts you want to be saved to PDF. The instructions explain that it is important to be selective.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: square;">To specify the selection criteria, you create one or more rules, called <em>filters</em>. You build rules that can operate alone or be logically combined with other rules in order to specify very precisely what you want to save. The example rule below specifies Test Attempts in that category from a Test named <em>Marking Test</em>.</li>
            <p>Clear and detailed instructions about how to set these up are found at <a href="../../D_Settings/Building Filters/Filters Introduction.htm">Building Filters</a>. </p>
            <li style="list-style-type: square;">Click <strong>Export to PDF</strong> to save the file.</li>
