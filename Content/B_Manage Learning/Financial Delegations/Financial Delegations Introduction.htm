        <h1 class="Heading1">Financial Delegations – Introduction</h1>
        <p>Financial Delegations is a Multi-step financial approval system that allows organisations to set financial approval limits for different positions along a managerial hierarchy. When a user attempts to enrol into a course with Financial Delegations applied to it, the enrolment request is sent through a hierarchy of positions for approval. Enrolments can only be approved by a position whose Financial Delegation level meets the required price of the catalogue item which the enrolment request is for.</p>
        <p>The level of Financial Delegation a user has, is assigned to their position. Usually, positions lower in the managerial hierarchy would have less Financial Delegation than positions higher up. However, positions can be configured in any way that suits the organisation.</p>
        <p>In the example below, there are four positions. The lowest position of Requesters has no level of Financial Delegation. Requesters report to First Position. The Managers within First Position have a Financial Delegation level of $500, therefore, these managers can approve Requester’s enrolments costing up to $500. If a First Position manager decides to approve the enrolment but not the cost, that enrolment is sent further up the hierarchy to the next manager for approval.</p>
        <p>Managers who are linked in the hierarchy or share the same position can redirect the approval process to different managers.</p>
        <p>If a Requester chooses an inactive Manager as their approver the system will pass the approval ownership over them to the next available manager higher up in the managerial hierarchy.</p>
