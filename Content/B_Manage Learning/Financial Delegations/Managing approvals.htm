        <h1 class="Heading1">Managing approvals</h1>
        <p>When a user requests enrolment into a course with Financial Delegation the system sends the enrolment to their preferred manager for approval. A manager can choose to <b class="Strong" style="font-weight: bold;">approve</b> the enrolment <b class="Strong">with cost</b>, <b class="Strong">approve</b> the enrolment <b class="Strong">without cost</b> or <b class="Strong">reject</b> the enrolment.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Approval with cost</h2>
        <p>Browse to <b class="Strong">Manage Learning</b> &gt; <b class="Strong">Approve Learning.</b></p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Financial Delegations/Managing approvals.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>Within <b class="Strong">Approve Learning</b> you will see a list of all outstanding approval requests.</p>
        <p>The key aspects of this list are:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
            <li>The <b class="Strong">Price</b> of this enrolment. If the <b class="Strong">Confirm cost with learner</b> setting is enabled the price will reflect the value the requester input.</li>
            <li>The <b class="Strong">With Cost</b> check box shows whether you are approving the enrolment with or without cost. If selected, the enrolment will be approved.</li>
            <li>The Next Approver column shows who this request will be sent to if approved without cost.</li>
            <li>The <b class="Strong">View more</b> link will take you to the enrolment details page where you can approve this enrolment or redirect it to a different approver.</li>
        </ol>
        <p> <img src="../../Resources/Images/Financial Delegations/Managing approvals_1.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" /></p>
        <p>To approve With Cost:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select the check box left of the User.</li>
            <li>Select the <b class="Strong">With Cost</b> check box.</li>
            <li>Select <b class="Strong">Approve</b>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p> <img src="../../Resources/Images/Financial Delegations/Managing approvals_2.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" /></p>
        <ol start="4">
            <li>Select <b class="Strong">Yes</b> to confirm the action.</li>
        </ol>
        <p> <img src="../../Resources/Images/Financial Delegations/Managing approvals_3.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" /></p>
        <p>This will approve the enrolment and allow the user access to the learning.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Approval without cost</h2>
        <p>If an enrolment’s price is above your level of Financial Delegation you are only able to approve the enrolment without cost. You may also choose to approve an enrolment without cost even if the enrolment is within your level of Financial Delegation.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select the check box left of the user’s name.</li>
            <li>Clear the <b class="Strong">With Cost</b> check box. Notice, that if an enrolment is outside of your Financial Delegation level the <b class="Strong">With Cost</b> check box is cleared and locked automatically.</li>
            <li>Select <b class="Strong">Approve</b>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p> <img src="../../Resources/Images/Financial Delegations/Managing approvals_4.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" /></p>
        <ol start="4">
            <li>Select <b class="Strong">Yes</b> to confirm the action.</li>
        </ol>
        <p> <img src="../../Resources/Images/Financial Delegations/Managing approvals_5.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" /></p>
        <p>Approval without cost will send the enrolment to the next available approver in your managerial hierarchy. In this example, the Next Approver is Francie Finamore. If Francie has the required level of Financial Delegation to approve the cost he is able to approve with cost, otherwise, he would approve it without the cost and send it on to the next approver.</p>
        <p>If the enrolment goes through this process several times and reaches the last manager or the last manager in a managerial hierarchy with a Financial Delegations level high enough to approve the request, the <b class="Strong">With Cost</b> check box becomes selected and locked.</p>

        </p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Rejecting enrolments</h2>
        <p>Enrolments can be rejected in the same way as above. Select <b class="Strong">Reject</b> and confirm the action via the popup. This will cancel the enrolment against the requesting user.</p>
