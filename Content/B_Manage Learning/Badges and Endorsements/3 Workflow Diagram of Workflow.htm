        <p>This explanation concludes by consolidating the way in which endorsements and badges work in conjunction with the People page. </p>
        <p>The only setup required to have the People page be made visible is to add it to your custom menu using the following XML: </p>
        <p>&lt;knownMenuItem id="people" caption="People" /&gt;<br /><img src="../../Resources/Images/Badges and Endorsements/3 Workflow Diagram of Workflow_1.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" /></p>
        <p>This page will show learners how many badges, and which badges their peers have acquired and how many people have endorsed them against the badge. As per the image above you can see Learner 1 has earned two badges, and even though has applied for endorsement for both the badges – her peers have only endorsed her for one badge. The other has (0) endorsements.</p>
        <p>Warning: This page will show every user that is in your Cloud Learning System, the page cannot be segregated between Organisations, Organisation Units or Groups. Every user in the system has the ability to endorse another learner and see that learners endorsements on the People page. Notes: Every user in the system if the permission is switched on has the ability to endorse another learner. </p>
