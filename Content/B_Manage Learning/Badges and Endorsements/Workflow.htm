        <h2 class="Heading2">1 Workflow – Completing Linked Activities and Applying for Endorsement</h2>
        <p>To be able to apply for endorsement a learner must first complete any linked activities to the competency. Since the linked activities are pages (in a module) you’ll want to make sure the learner is enrolled in the course catalogue before the learner can start to achieve endorsement.</p>
        <p>After the learner has completed the activity the Evidence submitted block icon will change to a tick, an Apply button will also appear on the right hand side. </p>

        <p>When the learner clicks on the apply button – it will confirm they have applied for endorsement. </p>
