        <p>Endorsements work alongside Competencies and give learners the opportunity for recognition of their peers skills and completion of linked activities. Once endorsed, the learner receives a badge – to show they have received the competency. This functionality was designed specifically for a MOOC environment and should be implemented by the same token. This document will explain the steps to setting up the feature and as well as using it from a learning perspective. </p>
        <p>To begin, ensure the Competency Endorsements page is added to your Custom Menu. <br />Example code: </p>
        <p>&lt;externalMenuItem id="Endorsements" caption="Endorsements" url="/CompetencyManagement/Competencyendorsements/index?menu=Home" target="_self" /&gt;</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
