        <h2 class="Heading2">3 Setup – Endorsement Settings</h2>
        <h3 class="Heading3">Step 1: Minimum Activity</h3>
        <p>You can set a minimum number of Activities (pages) the learner must complete before they are allowed to apply for endorsement (this will be explained later). If the field is left blank, this will mean that learners can apply for endorsement at any one time. Otherwise; this could be used e.g. you have 5 activities linked, but the learner only needs to complete 1 to solicit endorsement. </p>

        <h3 class="Heading3">Step 2: Linked Activities</h3>
        <p>This is the part where you actually link your activities (remember, these are pages). Simply search for the page you want to link and click the Add button.<br /><img src="../../Resources/Images/Badges and Endorsements/3 Setup Endorsement Settings_1.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" /></p>
        <h3 class="Heading3">Step 3: Evidence</h3>
        <p>Learners can provide a form of evidence for others to base their endorsement upon, to do this you must have LinkedIn or Pathbrite configured in your CLS. If you don’t, the checkbox’s will not be checkable. This is not required to implement the endorsement functionality. </p>

        </p>
        <h3 class="Heading3">Step 4: Evaluation Instructions</h3>
        <p>You can provide instructions for endorsers (these are also referred to as peers, but are technically just users) on how to endorse someone. Or explain why they should endorse another user. These instructions will appear as a rubric when endorsing another user. </p>

        <h3 class="Heading3">Step 5: External Badge Settings</h3>
        <p>You can specify an external badge that the learner will receive if they earn an endorsement. This is mostly used to link conventions that might be used outside of the CLS. </p>
