            <li>If you click the box next to <b>Allow users to register interest</b> two new checkboxes appear and you must select one of them. The second option accommodates the less common situation where you want to gauge User interest but <b>not</b> enrol them.</li>

            <li style="list-style-type: disc;"><b>Add interested users to the event waitlist:</b>
            </li>
            <p>This will enrol Users in the Learning Event and put them into the event waiting list. Session management screens show this waiting list and Users can be moved from the list and into Sessions.</p>

            </li>
            <p>This will NOT enrol Users in the Learning Event. Instead it will put them on the list of Users that have registered interest in the event, which is seen at the bottom of the Learning Event inspection screen: </p>

            <p>Because the Users are not enrolled, the list is not visible in Manage Sessions and thus there is no option to move these Users into a Session. Users can however remove themselves from the Registered Interest list. <b>Warning</b>: Choose this option if you <em>only</em> want to gauge User interest in the Event for reporting and notification purposes. This option would frustrate Users who want to enrol and participate because enrolment in the event does not happen. </p>

            <li>If you check this option then learners self-enrolling in a Program containing this Learning Event must also select a Sesssion (or join a waitlist) when they enrol.

        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li><b>When user withdraws don't add them to the event waitlist for future sessions</b>
            </li>
            <p>When the User withdraws s/he will not be added to the event waitlist and the enrolment is cancelled. However, if the User has enrolled in a Program rather than a Catalogue Item, i.e there are other Learning Asset components involved in the enrolment, then the enrolment will not be cancelled.</p>
