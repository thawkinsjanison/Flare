        <p>In most circumstances, Sessions are assigned a Venue and the Venue is linked to a Location. </p>
        <p>In order to provide maps and location instructions to Session attendees, the Venue must be linked to a Location that has been defined with a physical address.</p>
     
       
         <p>There are a number of ways to set up Venues and Locations:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Create a <a href="../../D_Settings/Venues/Add a Venue.htm">Venue</a> and create or edit its Location on the same screen.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Create a <a href="../../D_Settings/Locations/Add a Location.htm">Location</a>, then create a Venue and link it to the Location.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;"><a href="../../D_Settings/Venues/Import Venues and Locations.htm">Import </a>Venues and Locations using a spreadsheet.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Use the <strong>QuickAdd Venue</strong> feature when you are creating a Session. You can also create a Location at the same screen if required. This Location will have the same name as the Venue, thus making the Venue and Location an obvious pair.</li>
        </ul>
