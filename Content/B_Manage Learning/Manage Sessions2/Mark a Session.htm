        <h1 class="Heading1">Mark a Session</h1>
        <p>Authorised User(s) need to review the Users attending a Session and to mark whether they attended or not. Depending on what has been set up for the Learning Event, Competencies may also need to be awarded.</p>
        <p>To mark a Session select <b>Manage Learning</b> &gt; <b>Manage Sessions</b>. Locate the Session and click its <b>Mark</b> icon.</p>
        <p>
            <img class="shareWithMenu" src="../../Resources/Images/Manage Sessions2/Mark a Session.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>The main components of the screen show: </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
            <li>The name of the Session and a hyperlink to its Learning Event</li>
            <li>The details of the Session </li>
            <li>A list of the Attendees. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img class="shareWithMenu" src="../../Resources/Images/Manage Sessions2/Mark a Session_1.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;;" start="4">
            <li>To mark an attendee, click the <strong>Status</strong> drop-down list for each User and select one of the attendance options.</li>
            <p>If  <strong>Enable 'Interviewed Or Rpl' Attendance Status</strong> has been checked in the <a href="../../B_Manage Learning/Manage Sessions2/Learning Event Settings.htm">Learning Event Settings</a>, then you can also select this status option. In this case you must also add some notes, see <strong>5</strong>. </p>
            <li>You can add notes to a User's attendance record by clicking the <strong>pencil</strong> icon. A box opens for text entry. Click the pencil again to close it. </li>
            <li>Alternatively, if there are a large number of Users, you can click the checkbox at the top left of the list or the box to the left of each User and use the <b>Mark Selected As</b> option to bulk assign attendance status.&#160; </li>
            <li>Marks are not submitted until you click <b>Submit Marks</b>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You will be asked to confirm this:</p>

            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Manage Sessions2/Mark a Session_2.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" /> <img src="../../Resources/Images/Manage Sessions2/Mark a Session_3.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" /><img src="../../Resources/Images/Manage Sessions2/Mark a Session_2.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" /></p>
        <p>Note that there will be an additional column in the list above if Competencies were attached to the Session's Learning Event and the option was selected when <a href="../../B_Manage Learning/Manage Sessions2/Add Learning Event.htm">creating the Learning Event</a> to require the facilitator to manually award Competencies. </p>
        <p>If this is the case, click in the Competencies area and click the check box to award the Competency:</p>

        </p>
        <p>Note also that if you need to come back and modify the marks in a completed Session, you first need to edit the Session and change its status to <em>Published</em>.</p>
