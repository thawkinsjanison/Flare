        <h1 class="Heading1">Manage a Session and Waiting Lists</h1>
        <p>Once an Event and its Sessions have been created and the Event has been placed into a Catalogue Item, it is available for Users to register their interest, depending on the settings, see <a href="Session process.htm#_Manage_Sessions_%E2%80%93"><span class="Hyperlink">Session process</span></a> for details.</p>
        <p>The <b>Manage Session</b> screen allows facilitators to examine a Session's details and allocate Users to that Session. </p>
        <p>The screen displays Users attending the Session. Beneath this are the Session and Event waiting lists. Users can be moved directly from the waitlists to the attendee list (and vice versa). When a User has been moved from a waitlist and into a Session s/he will receive a system notification email advising of the enrolment and Session details.</p>
        <p>To manage a Session select <b>Manage Learning</b> &gt; <b>Manage Sessions</b>. Find the Session and click its <b>manage </b>icon.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>You will be taken to the <b>Manage Session</b> screen. The top of the screen shows: </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
            <li>The names of the Session and a link to its Learning Event</li>
            <li>The details of the Session </li>
            <li>The number of places available</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You can also find links to edit or mark this Sesssion in the <strong>Actions</strong> menu. </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Attendees</h2>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="4">
            <li>In this section there is a list of Users attending the Session.</li>
            <li>You can delete an attendee by clicking the <strong>minus</strong> icon. S/he is then moved to the Session waitlist for this Session.</li>
            <p> In the other Sessions that are in the same Learning Event, this attendee will be seen in the Event Waitlist. Thus, s/he can be moved into a different Session and hence removed from all waiting lists.</p>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Manage Sessions2/Manage a Session and Waiting_3.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Waitlisted Users</h2>
        <p>There are two tabs under <b>Waitlisted Users</b>: the Sessions waitlist and the Event waitlist. Click a tab name to display that list. </p>
        <p>Both lists can be sorted by entering search terms and clicking<b> Search for users.</b></p>
        <p>If the appropriate <a href="../../B_Manage Learning/Manage Sessions2/Learning Event Settings.htm">Learning Event Settings</a> (point<strong> 3</strong>) are enabled you can also search for Groups with more then one member and/or Org Units.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="6">
            <li>The<strong> Session </strong>waiting list refers to the Session you are currently managing.</li>
            <li>The<strong> Event </strong>waiting list refers to the Learning Event attached to the Session you are managing.</li>
            <li>On either list click the <b>plus</b> icon to move a User. S/he will disappear from the waitlist and appear in the Attendee list for this Session.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Manage Sessions2/Manage a Session and Waiting_3b.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>Note that you do not have to save this screen for your waitlist changes to take effect.</p>
        <p>If you hover the cursor over a User in either waitlist a popup box shows their full name, Username, User profile picture and any other details that have been entered for the User. </p>
        <p>If you, the facilitator, have appropriate permissions (see <a href="../../D_Settings/Roles/Roles Introduction.htm">Roles</a>) then options to edit the User and change the password are shown.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">
            In that case, click <strong>Details</strong> to edit User details and <strong>Password</strong> to change the password.</p>
