        <p>You cannot create a Session in isolation because it must belong to a Learning Event:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Manage Sessions2/session0.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;border-left-style: none;border-left-width: 1px;border-right-style: none;border-right-width: 1px;border-top-style: none;border-top-width: 1px;border-bottom-style: none;border-bottom-width: 1px;" />
        </p>
        <p>You add a Session to an existing Learning Event and you can reach this functionality via several different screens, for example when you are inspecting the Learning Event's details screen or editing it.</p>
        <p>In Manage Sessions you can also select <b>Manage Learning</b> &gt;<b> Manage Sessions </b>and click <b>Add Session</b>. </p>

        <p>You are then taken to the <b>Manage Learning Assets</b> section of the CLS to the <strong>New Learning Event Session</strong> screen where you can add a Session to an existing Learning Event.</p>

            <p>You will be warned later if you enter a value for the maximum attendance that is larger than the capacity of the Venue you choose at <strong>9</strong>. </p>
            <p>Note that if you leave the <strong>Max Attendance</strong> field blank, the capacity of the Venue that you select in <strong>9</strong> will populate this field. You can override this.</p>

        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Manage Sessions2/Add Session_2.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="9">
            <li>Click and select a <strong>Venue</strong>, or </li>
            <li>Click <b>QuickAdd Venue</b> to create a new Venue and enter its name. </li>

            <p>You can now select this new Venue at <strong>9</strong>. </p>
            <p>You can also create a Location for this Venue at the same screen if you click <strong>Create location now </strong>before you save.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/Manage Sessions2/QuickAdd1.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
            </p>
            <p>A new Location will be created with the same name as the Venue and you can enter other location details. The address is important if you want learners and administrators to see Google maps of the Location.</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/Manage Sessions2/QuickAdd00.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
            </p>
            <p>If you have previously selected an existing Location for this new Venue, the button changes and you can click <strong>Edit location now</strong> if required. </p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/Manage Sessions2/QuickAdd2.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
            </p>
            <p>When you click <strong>Save</strong>, the Venue and the Location will both be saved. </p>
            <p>Note that when you add or edit a Location here, the same button changes again and you can <strong>cancel</strong> the Location create/edit with this button if needed before you click <strong>Save. </strong>Cancelling the creation of a Location will remove the name of the new Location from the Venue's Location box and allow you to select another Location from the drop-down list before saving the new Venue. Cancelling Location edit will leave the Location unchanged.</p>
            <li>Click the checkbox to show learners a map for the Location of this Session. Remember that an address needs to have been entered for the Location so that Google maps can find it.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="12">
            <li>To include attachments for learners use the <b>Upload Files</b> feature.<br />Click <b>Select Files</b> one or more times to include attachments. You can remove a file using the little cross icon on the right hand side.</li>
            <p>Note that because of the danger of overwhelming an email system, these attachments are not sent directly to attendees. Instead, they receive a link in their email/iCAL appointment that allows them to view the attachments via the <a href="Session summary screen.htm#_Session_summary_screen"><span class="Hyperlink">Session Summary screen</span></a> in the CLS.</p>
        </ol>

            <li>Click and select a name from the drop-down list then click the <strong>plus</strong> icon to add <b>facilitator(s</b>) for the Session. You can do this multiple times. You can remove a name using the <strong>minus</strong> icon on its right hand side.</li>
            <li>You can provide extra information about particular Sessions using the rich text editor. Users who are not attending will not see these instructions.</li>
            <p>To include an <strong>email address</strong> as a link, select <strong>Insert &gt; insert link. </strong>Enter <em>mailto:admin@email.com</em> for the Url address, replacing this email address with the required address.</p>
            <p>The information in <strong>Instructions</strong> will be provided to attendees in two ways:</p>
        </ol>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">In the CLS, on the Session Summary screen.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">In the iCAL email that is sent by the CLS to all attendees when they are enrolled in a Session.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="15">
            <li>Providers are set at the Catalogue Item level. However, sometimes a single Learning Event is provided by different organisations. In this case, you can enter a Provider for each Session. You can then use Customisable Reports to report on a Learning Event’s Session Providers and number of attendees, etc. </li>
            <p>Note that you can require that <em>all</em> Sessions have a Provider by setting this at the <a href="../../B_Manage Learning/Manage Sessions2/Add Learning Event.htm">Learning Event</a> level.</p>
