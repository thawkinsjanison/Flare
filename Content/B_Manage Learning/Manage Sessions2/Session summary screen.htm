        <p>Each Learning Event Session has its own summary screen that learners can view in the CLS.</p>
        <p>
            <img class="shareWithMenu" src="../../Resources/Images/Manage Sessions2/Session summary screen.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>From this page, learners can:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">View Session information.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Download attachments.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Choose whether to attend or withdraw from the session (if permitted, see <a href="../../B_Manage Learning/Manage Sessions2/Session process.htm">Sessions process</a> for details)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">See a Google map popup of the venue Location by clicking the Venue name:</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img class="shareWithMenu" src="../../Resources/Images/Manage Sessions2/Session summary screen_1.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>Note that <b>Show map</b> needs to be checked for the Session and its Location and Venue set up with an address, see <a href="Locations Venues and maps.htm#_Locations_and_Venues"><span class="Hyperlink">Locations and Venues</span></a> for details</p>
        <p>Learners can access this screen from the Sessions list screen that they see after they enrol in the Learning Event or from their My Learning screen. Note that what they see here and how they get to it depends on the intersection of various settings, see <a href="../../B_Manage Learning/Manage Sessions2/Session process.htm">Sessions process</a>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Manage Sessions2/Session summary screen_2.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>Note also that this Session list screen is searchable, based on the Venue's name, suburb or postcode and start dates.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Manage Sessions2/SessionSearch.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>Another access to the Summary screen is provided to learners when the administrator inserts a hyperlink in the email message that is sent to Users when they enrol in a Session. This link takes learners to the Session summary screen. </p>
        <p>To insert this hyperlink using the rich text editor, select <strong>Insert &gt; insert link </strong>or click the link icon<strong>  <![CDATA[ ]]></strong>:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Manage Sessions2/Session summary screen_3.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>Type the name of the token [Session.SessionDetailsLink] into the URL address:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Manage Sessions2/Session summary screen_4.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>In the example above, the link will appear as <strong>Click here</strong> to learners and it will take them to the Session summary screen.</p>
        <p>This link to the Session summary screen can also be inserted into any Template relating to Learning Event Sessions by using the same token, see <a href="../../B_Manage Learning/Manage Sessions2/Message Templates and Sessions.htm">Message Templates</a>.</p>
