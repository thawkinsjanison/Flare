        <p>There are a number of different types of Learning Assets in the CLS. All Learning Assets need to be linked to a <strong>Catalogue Item</strong> in order for learners to be enrolled in them. This section describes a Learning Assett called a <strong>Learning Event</strong>.</p>

        <p>A Learning Event is training that takes place when a learner User actually attends a venue, including a virtual venue (webinar). It is made up of one or more <strong>Sessions </strong>that learners attend.</p>
        <p>A Learning Event can consist of:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">a single Session</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">multiple Sessions</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">multiple Sessions in various locations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A User enrols in one Session in a Learning Event. A Session has a date and time, a facilitator, specific instructions, etc. In particular, a Session usually has a <strong>Venue</strong> that is linked to a <strong>Location</strong>. All these details can change from Session to Session within one Learning Event. </p>
        <p>Each Session has its own summary page in the CLS that learners can access. This can include detailed instructions, a map and possibly files for them to download. When a Session is edited there is also an option to inform its attendees that the Session details have changed.</p>
        <p>A Learning Event without Sessions can be used for registering interest or waitlisting Users, with the possibility of creating Sessions later when the training and/or interest is confirmed. A Learning Event with Sessions can be used to auto enrol Users via workflows or as above for registering interest and waitlisting Users.</p>
        <p>Note that if a Session runs over more than one day learners are required to attend all of this time in order to complete the Session. However, one Session cannot, for example, run just in the morning for several days. If this format is required then a separate Event should be created for each morning Session so that Users can enrol in each morning Session.</p>
        <p>There are a number of types of Learning Events:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Face to face</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Conference</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Informal Session</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Lecture</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Mentoring</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Webinar</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Workshop</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You create and edit Learning Events in the <b>Manage Learning</b> &gt; <b>Manage Learning Assets</b> section of the CLS. Once a Learning Event has been created, you add and edit its Sessions in the same location. </p>
        <p>You manage (e.g. moving attendees between waiting lists) and mark Sessions through <b>Manage Learning</b> &gt; <b>Manage Sessions</b>, which also provides links for the creation of Learning Events and the creation and editing of Sessions. </p>
        <p>Note that you can also create Learning Events and Sessions through <b>Manage Learning</b> &gt; <b>Add Learning</b>. This is a setup wizard that also creates a linked Catalogue Item so that Users can be enrolled.</p>
