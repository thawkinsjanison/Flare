        <h5 class="Heading1">CPD Introduction</h5>
        <p>Continuing Professional Development (CPD) is a system by which people maintain their knowledge and skills related to their professional lives. Many professions define CPD as a structured approach to learning to help ensure competence to practice, taking in knowledge, skills and practical experience. In order to continue in their chosen profession many individuals are required to accrue a certain amount of CPD points throughout the year. CPD can involve any relevant learning activity, whether formal and structured or informal and self-directed.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">How does CPD work in the CLS?</h2>
        <p>The CLS can successfully track, maintain and report on a user's CPD progress.</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Users are linked to a CPD plan. The plan specifies the required points the user need to achieve to meet the requirement to become compliant.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Points are assigned to catalogue items and when each catalogue item is completed by the user the linked points are achieved by the user.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Once all the points in the plan have been achieved the user become compliant.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The CPD feature has several dependencies that need to be setup prior to allocating or undergoing CPD:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Tags are used to name the points. An example of a Tag for a paramedic CPD point is ‘Clinical’.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">CPD plans are made up of sets of requirements and are linked to users to make them aware of what they need to do to become compliant. CPD plans are covered in more detail further down but if you would like to have a preview you will find the details <a href="CPD Plans.htm#_CPD_Plans"><span class="Hyperlink">here</span></a>.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Points are allocated to Tags in the CPD plan putting a name and number to requirements.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) should be enabled as points can be assigned to users if they are achieved outside of their current employment.</li>
        </ul>
