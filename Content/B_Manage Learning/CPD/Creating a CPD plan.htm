        <p>The New CPD plan form will require the following information. Please see the image at the bottom of this list to view the related fields:</p>

        <h2 class="Heading2">What points are required?</h2>
        <p>A CPD Plan requires learners to achieve points by completing Learning from different categories. In the CLS the categories are defined using Tags. </p>
        <p>This section of the CPD plan form allows you to select any number of tags, and the minimum number of points that a learner must obtain from each tag during the CPD period.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In the Tags field drop-down select the tag you would like to add to the plan. You can add as many tags as needed. Click the Add button to add it to the plan.</li>
            <li>Enter the Minimum Points for each tag, this is the minimum number of points that a User must obtain in the plan period.</li>
            <li>Enter the Total points required which is calculated from above tags.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/CPD/Creating a CPD plan_4.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>Note that the Total points shows the overall percentage completed in the chart and total points below the chart. The chart is covered later in the document. The chart only shows completed when all tags are completed and all points obtained</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Which user does this rule apply to?</h2>
        <p>This section allows you to specify which Users you would like to add to the plan. In the screenshot below all active users will be added to the plan. You could add filters such as organisations, job positions and many more.</p>
        <p>For more information on building filters please refer to the document on Customisable reports &gt; Building Filters.</p>

            <li style="list-style-type: circle;">Current Members - Users that are already members of the plan.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: circle;">To be Added -Users that, according to the ‘Which users does this rule apply to?’ section of the CPD Plan, match the rule.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: circle;">To be Deactivated - Users that, according to the ‘Which Users does this rule apply to?’ section of the CPD Plan, no longer match the rule. This can occur when a rule on a CPD Plan is changed after Users have become members</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: circle;">Inactive – Users who used to meet the rule but were deactivated are now listed as inactive.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Based on the filter we set up in the above example, there are 10 Users (all Active Users) who will be added to this plan.</p>

            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Click the Update Membership Now button to add these Users.</li>

        <h2 class="Heading2">Rollover Membership</h2>
        <p>This feature allows you to refresh the CPD Plan Membership for a new period and gives you the option to set a start date for the new plan. Setting the new plan will complete the currently active membership and a new membership will be created. Be careful as this cannot be undone. </p>
        <p>The purpose of this feature is to create a new membership for the user if users need to continuously meet their CPD requirements. In professions such as paramedics, training is ongoing.</p>
        <p>The old plan membership can be viewed on the current plan membership details page in the section called Membership History.</p>
