        <h5 class="Heading1"><a name="_CPD_Plans"></a>CPD Plans</h5>
        <p>CPD plans allow you to design the CPD requirements and allocate the plan to specific users within the system. For example a CPD plan for a lawyer will differ to a CPD plan for a paramedic. The CPD requirements are set by selecting Tags and specifying how many points a user must reach to satisfy the requirement and in what timeframe they have to achieve this.</p>
