        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
            <li>My CPD tile. This tile shows for Users with a CPD Plan. At a glance the tile shows circular graphs with the CPD Status.</li>

        <h2 class="Heading2">Enrolment in CPD Catalogue Items</h2>
        <p>Users can be manually enrolled in CPD Catalogue Items or/and CPD Catalogue Items can be setup to appear under ‘Browse Learning’ where users can self-enrol into the catalogue items. </p>
        <p>Users that are self-enrolling will need to view their ‘My CPD Plan’ to determine which Tags are needed to complete their CPD. Users will then need to see the Tags associated with the catalogue items in the ‘Browse Learning’ area so they can determine which catalogue items to enrol in.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Display Tags on Tiles in Browse Learning</h2>
        <p>Tags can be displayed to Users on Catalogue Item tiles when they are self-enrolling from Browse Learning.</p>
