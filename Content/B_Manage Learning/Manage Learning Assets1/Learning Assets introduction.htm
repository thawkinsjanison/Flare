        <h1 class="Heading1">Learning Assets – introduction </h1>
        <p>There are a number of different types of Learning Assets in the CLS. Each type needs to be linked to a Catalogue Item in order for learner Users to enrol or be enrolled in it.</p>
        <p>A Learning Asset is essentially a vessel of information: an intellectual property contained in the CLS that helps Users learn or that tests their understanding. Learning Assets can take many forms including Courses, Modules, documents, videos, Learning Events, Tests and much more, see <a href="Types of Learning Assets.htm#_Types_of_Learning"><span class="Hyperlink">Types of Learning Asset</span></a>.</p>
        <p>A Learning Asset can be integrated with the Janison CLS in a number of ways:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
            <li>It can be created within the CLS using the functionality available through the Design section (i.e. creating Janison Courses, Modules, Pages, Tests, Questions, etc.). </li>
            <li>It can be created outside the CLS and imported into the CLS (e.g. a SCORM course)</li>
            <li>It can take place outside the system and be monitored inside the system (e.g. face to face events, called Sessions and Learning Events)</li>
            <li>It can occur outside the CLS but be linked into the CLS (e.g. Other Learning)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These types of learning can be added to the CLS system using various methods:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Semi-automatic: the <strong>Add Learning</strong> wizard works with categories 2-4 of the list above. This wizard creates a new Learning Asset and puts it into a new Catalogue Item, see <a href="../../B_Manage Learning/Add Learning/Adding Learning introduction.htm">Add Learning</a></li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Manual: use <strong>Manage Learning Asset &gt; Add Learning Asset</strong> to add all types of Learning Assets, see <a href="Manage Learning Assets.htm#_Manage_Learning_Assets"><span class="Hyperlink">Manage Learning Assets</span></a></li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Manual: use <strong>Design &gt; Courses &gt; Add Course</strong> to add a new (Janison) Course, see Courses</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note that:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Users cannot actually enrol in a Learning Asset until it is linked to a Catalogue Item, see Manage Catalogues. </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">When a Catalogue item contains more than one Learning Asset it is known as a Program but it has the same functionality as a Catalogue item, see Manage Catalogues.</li>
        </ul>
