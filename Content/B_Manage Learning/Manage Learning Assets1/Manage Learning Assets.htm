        <h1 class="Heading1"><a name="_Manage_Learning_Assets"></a>Manage Learning Assets</h1>
        <p>Manage Learning Assets allows authorised Users to create new Learning Assets and to search for, inspect and edit existing Learning Assets. Where appropriate, you are taken to other parts of the CLS. For example, when you add a new Learning Asset and it is a Course, the system takes you to Design &gt; Courses &gt; New Course.</p>
        <p>Note that an alternative to creating new Learning Assets using Manage Learning Assets is to use the Add learning wizard. This is a setup assistant that creates a new Learning Asset and also puts it into a new Catalogue Item with the same name, so that it is possible for users to enrol in it. See Add Learning</p>
        <p>Note also that the Sessions that offer face to face learning in the CLS have specialised functions such as waiting lists and marking managed in a separate section of the CLS. Select Manage Learning &gt; Manage Sessions.</p>
        <p>To access Manage Learning Assets select Manage Learning &gt; Manage Learning Assets</p>

        <p>You will then see list of all the Learning Assets.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 38pt;" start="1">
            <li>The list divided into Active and Inactive groups. Click the tabs to display each group.</li>
            <li>To make a Learning Asset inactive click the check box beside it then click Archive (3)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To make a Learning Asset inactive click Inactive tab,click the check box beside it and click Unarchive</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 38pt;" start="4">
            <li>The list of Learning Assets shows names, icons, types and the dates of last update. You can sort the list by each of these values by clicking on the heading.</li>
            <li>Click Search for Learning Assets to display the search function where you can enter search terms including the type of Learning Asset and creation dates and then click Search</li>
        </ol>

        </p>
        <p>To inspect a Learning Asset in more detail, click its name. With some types of Learning Asset you will continue on in the Learning Assets section of the CLS; with other types you will be taken to the appropriate section of the CLS. </p>
        <p>Inspection screens show the key features of that type of Learning Asset. All inspection screens include some common elements:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 95pt;" start="1">
            <li>Tasks, Notes and Attachments can be viewed and added</li>
            <li>If the Learning Event is not linked to a Catalogue Item Users cannot enrol in it. Clicking Add it now takes you to New Catalogue Item with this Learning Event already in place so that you can remedy the problem. An alternative is to separately create/edit an appropriate Catalogue Item and then add this Learning Event to it (see Edit Catalogue Item).</li>
            <li>You can edit the Learning Asset by clicking the appropriate icon at the top left hand side of the inspection screen.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Manage Learning Assets1/Manage Learning Assets_3.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 698px;height: 154px;" />
        </p>
        <p>The rest of an inspection screen depends on what was entered when that the Learning Asset was first added, see the Add Learning Asset details. An exception is the Learning Event inspection screen, where dynamic information relating to its linked Sessions and its waiting lists is displayed, see <a href="Inspect Learning Asset Learning.htm#_Inspect_Learning_Asset"><span class="Hyperlink">Inspect Learning Asset - Learning Event</span></a>.</p>
