        <h1>Add Learning Asset - Add Session </h1>
        <p>Sessions are where a User actually attends a venue, including a virtual venue (webinar). Session information includes the when, the where and the capacity of the event. This information can change from Session to Session within one Learning Event. See Manage Sessions for more details about Sessions including how they are managed and marked.</p>
        <p>There are a couple of ways to add a Session, each involves specifying the Learning Event it will be attached to. You can select Manage Learning &gt; Manage Sessions &gt; Add Session, see Manage Sessions &gt; Add Session</p>
        <p>Alternatively, select Manage Learning &gt; Manage Learning Assets. Click the desired Learning Event to inspect it and click Add Session.</p>
