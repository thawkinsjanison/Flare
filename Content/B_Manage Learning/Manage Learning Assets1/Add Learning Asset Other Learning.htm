        <h1 class="Heading1">Add Learning Asset - Other Learning</h1>
        <p>Other Learning is designed to manage external learning already undertaken by a user. For example a staff member may have completed their first aid certificate or completed a machinery licence run by an external provider and the staff member must show proof of completion i.e. a licence or certificate.</p>
        <p>When a learner User enrols in an Other Learning they are required to provide information (including notes) and, depending on how it was set up, possibly a document and/or a person to provide verification. Note that when a learner uploads a file for verification and nominates a manager or authorised staff member to verify the credentials that person will be sent an email which contains a link. Following this link is the only way for the nominated person to verify the learning.</p>
        <p>To add Other Learning select <strong>Manage Learning &gt; Manage Learning Assets </strong>and then click <strong>Add Learning Asset</strong>. Select <em>New Other Learning</em> from the options offered.</p>
