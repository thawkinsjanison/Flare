        <h1>Add Learning Asset - SCORM Course</h1>
        <p>SCORM stands for Shareable Content Object Reference Model. SCORM courses are courses that have been created in 3rd party applications such as Lectora and Captivate. They can be exported to disk (as SCORM compliant zip files) and imported into the CLS. </p>
        <p>Learner Users enrol in a Catalogue Item that contains the SCORM course Learning Asset. This launches the SCORM course player in a separate browser window. User progress through the course is tracked by the CLS and classified as Not Attempted, Incomplete or Complete as appropriate.</p>
        <p>Before adding this type of learning make sure that your file is a SCORM compliant zip file. Note that the default upload limit is 200MB. If you require a larger limit please contact the Janison Development team with a request to increase the size. </p>
        <p>To add a SCORM Course, browse to <b>Manage Learning</b> &gt; <b>Manage Learning Assets</b>.</p>
