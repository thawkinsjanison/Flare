        <h1 class="Heading1">Create and Run a Custom Report</h1>
        <p>After you have created a Report, you run it and display its results. The results screen will offer you the options to export these results, save the Report itself or edit the Report.</p>
        <p>There are two ways to create a new Report: you can create one from scratch (see below) or you can locate and run an existing Report and then refine (edit) it, see <a href="Inspect a Custom Report.htm#_Inspect_a_Custom"><span class="Hyperlink">Inspect a Custom Report</span></a>.</p>
        <p>To create a new Report select <strong>Manage Learning &gt; Customisable Reports</strong> and click <strong>Create a Report</strong></p>
        <p>
            <img class="shareWithMenu" src="../../Resources/Images/Customisable Reports/Create a Custom Report.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <ol start="1">
            <li>Click under <strong>Entity</strong> and select the required entity from the drop-down list. You can only select one entity per Report.</li>
            <p>In this example Enrolment has been selected.</p>
            <li>If desired, select parts of the entity by building <strong>Filters</strong> to apply to it. See instructions in 
                <a href="../../B_Manage Learning/Customisable Reports/Notes on building filters.htm">Building Filters</a>.</li>
            <p>In this example, a simple filter selects enrolments where the User has a Basic User Role.</p>
        </ol>

        </p>
        <p>  If you have enabled the setting, you can also specify that any <a href="../../B_Manage Learning/Customisable Reports/Export Report Results.htm">export</a> of the results of this Report uses an <a href="../../B_Manage Learning/Customisable Reports/Using Custom Report Templates.htm">Excel Template</a>. In this case, the only export format will be Excel.</p>

        </p>
        <ol start="3">
            <li>In <strong>Select Columns</strong> check the details (fields) of the entity that you want included in your Report. </li>
            <p>The fields that you can select are different for each entity. Note that these options also give you a useful sense of the information that is stored in the CLS for an entity. </p>
            <p>In this example 3 fields have been selected. To simplicity the screenshot, unselected fields have been removed from the image.</p>
        </ol>
        <ol start="4">
            <li>Click <strong>Set column order</strong> if you want to customise the display order of the columns of information.</li>
            <p>Change the order by dragging rows (e.g. <em>Full Name</em> in the example below) up or down in the list and click <strong>OK</strong></p>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Customisable Reports/Create a Custom Report_2.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <ol start="5">
            <li>Click <strong>Run Report </strong>to display the results of the Report.</li>

            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Customisable Reports/Create a Custom Report_3.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>The results of your Report are displayed on the screen:</p>

        </p>
        <p>The results screen also has options at the top of the screen to <a href="../../B_Manage Learning/Customisable Reports/Export Report Results.htm">export</a> these results, <a href="../../B_Manage Learning/Customisable Reports/Save the Report.htm">save</a> the Report itself or edit (refine) the Report.</p>
