        <h1>Schedule a Report</h1>
        <p>You can schedule a Report to run in the future, including running on a regular basis. Its results can be either saved to disk or emailed to a recipient. </p>
        <p>If you have specified in the Report that the export results use an <a href="../../B_Manage Learning/Customisable Reports/Using Custom Report Templates.htm">Excel Template</a> then the template will be applied to the results before they are exported to an Excel file.</p>
        <p>To schedule a Report navigate to <strong>Manage Learning &gt; Customisable Reports</strong> and locate the required Report in the list. There are two scheduling options:</p>

            <img class="shareWithMenu" src="../../Resources/Images/Customisable Reports/Schedule Report.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <ol start="1">
            <li><strong>Schedule</strong> the Report to be run and <strong>emailed</strong>.</li>
            <p>Click the <strong>@</strong> icon. This takes you to <strong>Schedule a Job</strong> in <strong>Settings</strong> where you can specify when the Report should be run and who is emailed the file containing the Report results. This is the recommended scheduling option.</p>
            <p>If you want the Report emailed to more than one address, insert a semicolon between the addresses.</p>
            <li><strong>Schedule</strong> a Report to be run and saved to a <strong>File</strong>.</li>
            <p><b>Note</b>: This is a specialised feature and you will not have access to the file you have scheduled. For this reason we would recommend scheduling to email.</p>
            <p> Selecting the <img src="../../Resources/Images/Customisable Reports/Schedule Report_1.png" /> icon takes you to <strong>Schedule a Job</strong> in <strong>Settings</strong> where you can specify the scheduling settings.</p>
        </ol>
