        <p>You can set up rules to precisely define <strong>parts</strong> of a CLS entity that you want to report on. These rules are called <strong>filters</strong>. They can very precisely select members of an entity because they are combined using Boolean logic, which can also be nested. This will be best understood by someone who is comfortable with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Boolean operations (AND, OR, NOT), </li>
            <li>its language (e.g. “!” means “NOT”), and </li>
            <li>how nesting limits scope.</li>
        </ul>
                <p>Clear and detailed instructions about how to set these up are found at <a href="../../D_Settings/Building Filters/Filters Introduction.htm">Building Filters</a>, including a very simple introduction for beginers. You will find this filter finctionality in a number of places in the CLS.</p>

       
        <p>Using filters you can also make a Report pause while it is running in order to allow a filter value to be entered on the spot. You use the filter's <strong>Control</strong> checkbox, which is explained at point <strong>13</strong> in <a href="../../D_Settings/Building Filters/Building Filters.htm">Filters</a>.
        </p>
       
        
       
        
         
        
        
        
       
        <p>Note that an alternative to using filters is to export the results of your Report to an Excel file. In Excel you can do filtering and manipulation of the data in an application that many people are familiar with. </p>
       
        
        <p>Note also that in addition to the filters that you specify here, the system will append further filters based on Security roles. This makes the customisable reporting functionality available to a wider range of Users (as it doesn’t need to be restricted to administrator Users). It also leverages existing security settings about who can see who, for example, no special or separate configuration are required for a Supervisor to only see their staff, or a Teacher to only see their students. This makes it impossible for someone to accidentally be granted too many permissions at the reporting level and improves performance because most Users will only be able to see a subset of the total results. The security filtering applied is the same as for the User List Form (under <strong>Manage Users</strong> menu item) – the same Security filtering also applies to Reports on enrolment entities.</p>
