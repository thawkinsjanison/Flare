        <h1><a name="_Assigning_learning_-"></a>Assigning Learning - introduction</h1>
        <p>For Users to participate in the learning and assessment available in the CLS they need to be enrolled in Catalogue Item(s) and hence, assigned learning. This involves:</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">The learning content, i.e. the Catalogue Item(s)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">The recipients, i.e. the Users to be enrolled </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">The delivery options, i.e. enrol now or in the future</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are a number of different ways that enrolments can be done, see <a href="../../B_Manage Learning/Enrolments1/Enrolments introduction.htm">Enrolments</a> for more information. For example, the process can be done manually by assigning learning directly to selected Users from within a particular Catalogue Item, see <a href="Assign Learning Catalogue.htm#_Assign_Learning_%E2%80%93"><span class="Hyperlink">Assign Learning – Catalogue Item</span></a>. It can also be done by uploading a spreadsheet of Enrolment data containing lists of Catalogue Items, Users, Status, and so on, see <a href="../../B_Manage Learning/Enrolments1/Import Learning History.htm">Import Learning History</a>. Alternatively you can use <em>Assign Learning</em>, a wizard that creates Enrolments semi-automatically. Using the wizard you are presented with a series of screens and you fill them in to nominate when and how learning will be delivered and to whom. </p>
        <p>Once User Enrolments have been added to the CLS, they can be inspected and edited in the <strong>Enrolments</strong> section of the CLS.</p>
        <p>Note that a Catalogue Item that contains more than one Learning Asset becomes known as a Program but remains functionally the same (see <a href="../Manage Catalogue1/Extra features for Programs.htm">Programs</a>). Thus, references to Catalogue Items here also include Programs.</p>
