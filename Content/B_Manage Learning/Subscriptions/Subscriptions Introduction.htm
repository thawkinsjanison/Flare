        <p>Subscriptions allow you to manage access to catalogue items in a way that matches your business model. You can set up various subscriptions with different rates. Some examples include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A 10% discount could apply to items for a 1 month subscription.</li>
            <li>A 50% discount could apply to items for a 12 month subscription.</li>
            <li>A bronze level membership could give you a 15% discount for the year.</li>
            <li>A platinum membership could give you a 100% discount for the year.</li>
            <li>A lifetime subscription could give you an 80% discount for life.</li>
            <li>A ‘Technology Pack’ subscription could give you a 70% discount on all items in the ‘Technology Pack’.</li>
            <li>A negative rate subscription increases the price of some items. This could then be combined with a discount subscription.</li>
        </ul>
