        <h5 class="Heading1">Completion Rules</h5>
        <p>This is how you determine how your learner can complete their learning plan and, once they do, what happens next.</p>
        <p>The on-screen instructions will tell you what each option means.</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Rollover </span>– this allows the learner to take incomplete learning plan entries from a plan they are completing into their new plan. When a leaner rolls a plan over, a new enrolment in the same plan is automatically created and incomplete learning plan entries are populated to it.</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Can edit after completion</span> – allows a learner to edit a plan, even if they’ve completed it. </p>
        <p><span class="span_1">Be careful</span><span class="span_1">!</span> If the user rolls their plan over, they are creating a new enrolment in the same learning plan. They can only have one current enrolment in a learning plan so, once the new one is created and ready to edit, they will no longer be allowed to edit their old plans <span class="Emphasis">even if</span> you check this option.</p>
