        <h5 class="Heading1">Start / End Date rules</h5>
        <p>When you first open this section, you may be confused that it seems to have nothing you can do in it. Remember to use the pencil to edit.</p>
        <p>When you do, you can check “Allow Start/End date”. This opens up all the options to you.</p>
        <p>Some organisations want learning plans to have specific start / end dates. Some prefer to allow learners to choose their own start / end dates. Others don’t want plans to have end dates at all.</p>
        <p>If you don’t want start / end dates on your plans, don’t check “Allow Start / End date”</p>
        <p>If you want the learner to control their own start / end dates, check “Allow Start / End Date” and “Allow Learner / Manager to control Dates” but don’t set any rules</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>If you want more control over learning plans, you need to use start and end date rules</p>
        <p>Start date rule</p>
        <p>There are three choices</p>
        <ol start="1" class="ol_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph">The plan can start on the day the learner is enrolled in it</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">“Day of current calendar year” - the plan will start on a particular day of the current year (even if that day is in the past)</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">“Day of year from today” - the plan will start on a particular date when it next occurs. This means that, for example, if today is 15<sup>th</sup> March 2015 and you select 1 May, the plan will start on 1 May 2015. However, if you choose 1 March, the plan won’t start until 1 March 2016.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>End date rule</p>
        <p>There is only one choice – how many days or months after the plan starts should it end.</p>
        <p><span class="span_1">Be careful!</span> These rules only apply at the time the learner is enrolled in the plan. Once they are enrolled, any changes you make here won’t affect their plans.</p>
