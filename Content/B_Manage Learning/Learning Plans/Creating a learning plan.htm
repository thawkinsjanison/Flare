        <h5 class="Heading1">Creating a learning plan</h5>
        <p class="p_4">Learning plans are learning assets. You can use them in the same way you use any other learning asset.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3">Create the learning asset</h3>
        <p class="p_4">Note that you can’t use the “Add Learning” wizard for Learning Plans – they are too complex to work in the wizard. </p>
        <p class="p_4">You need to go to Manage Learning <span class="span_2">à</span> Manage Learning Assets and then add a new learning asset.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3">Adjust the plan settings</h3>
        <p class="p_4">Once you have created the learning asset, you will see the set-up screen</p>
        <p class="p_4">

        </p>
        <p class="p_4">This is where you customise the learning plan for your learners. For each area, click the title to open the section, click the pencil to edit the contents.</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Introduction text</h4>
        <p>If you have a way you’d like learners to use learning plans, specific instructions or other information you’d like to convey to learners when they are creating their plans, include it here. The editor allows for rich text so you can link a video presentation or other media if you want to. Whatever you enter here will be presented to every learner at the top of their main learning plan screen.</p>
        <h4 class="Heading4">Plan Settings</h4>
        <p>If you would like your learners to link catalogue items (i.e. items from within the JanisonCLS) to their learning plan, check this option. That way, they will get credit in their learning plan for the study they undertake.</p>
