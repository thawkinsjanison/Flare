        <h5 class="Heading1">Learning Plans Introduction</h5>
        <p>A Learning Plan is a plan in which an individual schedules particular learning that they would like to do, following an analysis of what knowledge and skills they need to achieve their career and personal goals. Learning Plans are often established for a particular period of time, for example one year, and are often subject to a management workflow – i.e. a manager needs to approve the learning plan submitted by a staff member. These functions and more are supported by learning plans in the JanisonCLS.</p>
        <p>Learning Plans are a kind of learning asset in the JanisonCLS. They function in almost all respects like any other learning asset. They can:</p>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph_1">Be added to catalogue items</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph_1">Be enrolled in </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph_1">Be completed</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph_1">Be subject to enrolment rules and group enrolments</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Learners can also have more than one learning plan at once, provided the learning asset is added to more than one catalogue item – you cannot have more than one enrolment in a catalogue item at once.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Learning Plan</h2>
        <p>At the highest level is the learning plan itself. The learning plan is personal to the learner and contains</p>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph_1">A statement about the learner’s broad goals;</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph_1">A list of the learner’s managers and supervisors;</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph_1">A number of specific learning objectives (referred to as Learning Plan Entries); and</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph_1">A journal.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Learning Plan Entries</h2>
        <p>The learner enters their broad goals and direction at the learning plan level. After this, the learner will determine a number of specific objectives that they would like to accomplish. These are recorded as Learning Plan Entries.</p>
        <p>Each entry has a number of attributes</p>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph_1">Description of the learning objective;</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph_1">What action the learner will take to meet that objective;</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph_1">A date by which the learner would like to meet that objective;</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph_1">The date on which the learner actually did meet that objective;</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph_1">A number of catalogue items that the learner will or has completed to help meet this objective; and</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph_1">Indicators of whether the objective is active and/or complete.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Learning Plan Entries can be added or removed at will by the learner unless they have been made mandatory by an administrator (see below).</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">The journal.</h2>
        <p>The journal serves three functions.</p>
        <ol start="1" class="ol_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph">It is a way for the learner and their manager to record comments as part of the approval process; </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">A place for the learner to reflect on the learning they have undertaken and how effective it has been; and</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">A place for the learner to upload documents that are valuable artefacts for the learner to use in the future for job applications, professional development audits etc. These might include (but are certainly not limited to) a CV, letters of reference, certificates and qualifications.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Recording accomplishments</h2>
        <p>When a learner completes an item from the catalogue in the JanisonCLS, that accomplishment can be linked back the learning plan.</p>
        <p>If the learner undertakes learning or professional development outside the JanisonCLS, they can get credit for that too using the “Log external learning” feature.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Activating the plug-ins</h2>
        <p>Your JanisonCLS will not support Learning Plans if you don’t have the “Plans” plug-in activated.</p>
        <p>If you are using the “Log external learning” feature, you will need to have the “Other Learning” plug-in activated.</p>
        <p>If you don’t have these activated, you will need to contact the Client Services Team at Janison. It will only take a moment to activate it.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Doing the background work</h2>
        <p>Before your users can have a learning plan, you need to do some set up work.</p>
        <p>Firstly, ask yourself some questions.</p>
        <p class="p_2">Do I want my users to link their learning plans to a particular set of professional standards or something similar?</p>
        <p class="p_3">If so, you will need to set up a tag for each standard and group them into one or more tag types. If you need help doing that..</p>
        <p class="p_3"><span class="Emphasis">Do I want to group my learning in any way?</span> Some organisations want learning grouped into learning areas or need to record which competency certain pieces of learning relate to. This is particularly relevant if your learners need to meet certain CPD or similar requirements.</p>
        <p class="p_3">If so, you need to set up a tag for each learning area and group them into one tag type.</p>
        <p class="p_3"><span class="Emphasis">Do I want my users to be able to record learning they have done outside the JanisonCLS</span><span class="Emphasis"> against their learning plans?</span>
        </p>
        <p class="p_3">If so, you will need to set up a learning asset of type “Other Learning” and link it to a catalogue item. In addition to the basic steps for completing this you will need to do four things:</p>
        <ol start="1" class="ol_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph">Check the “Allow learner to link to learning plan entry” box when you are editing the Learning Asset </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="p_3">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Learning Plans/Learning Plans Introduction.png" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <ol start="2" class="ol_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph">Give the Catalogue Item a name that will mean something to your learners. This is particularly important if you are going to use more than one catalogue item so that external learning can be recorded against different groups (see advanced user instructions below). Your learners will see the catalogue items in a drop down menu when they are editing their learning plans</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="p_3">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Learning Plans/Learning Plans Introduction_1.png" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <ol start="3" class="ol_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph">If your learners need to record a course accreditation number when they record their learning, you need to check the “Allows accreditation number” box </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="p_3">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Learning Plans/Learning Plans Introduction_2.png" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p class="p_3"><span class="span_1">Be careful!</span> If you are using this, it’s probably because some of the learning your learners will do outside the JanisonCLS will be accredited and some won’t be. Do not put a Course Accreditation Number on the catalogue item as well. If you do and the learner doesn’t enter a Course Accreditation Number when they record their learning, it will default to the one you put on the catalogue item.</p>
        <ol start="4" class="ol_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph">Make the catalogue item private (i.e. don’t publish it in the catalogue). If you need help with doing this.</li>
        </ol>
