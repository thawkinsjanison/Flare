        <h5 class="Heading1">Setting up the catalogue item</h5>
        <p>Use the Manage Catalogue &gt; Add Catalogue Item feature to add the learning asset (of type “Learning Plan”) that you have created to a catalogue item.</p>
        <p>You can make it public or private. </p>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph_1">If you want your learners to enrol themselves, make it public. It will then appear in the catalogue under “Browse Learning”.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph_1">If you want to control enrolments using Assign Learning or any of the automatic enrolment options, make the item private.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can assign any catalogue item settings you like to the catalogue item. It’s probably worth remembering, however:</p>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph_1">If you don’t want users to have to pay to have a plan, make sure the price is zero and the self-enrolment method is set to “Self-enrol (free)”.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph_1">Setting the self-enrol to “Manager approved” doesn’t mean that the manager will be asked to check the content of the learning plan, just asked to approve the learner starting a plan. </li>
            <li class="ListParagraph_1">Learning Plans don’t count as learning for the purposes of transcripts</li>
        </ul>
