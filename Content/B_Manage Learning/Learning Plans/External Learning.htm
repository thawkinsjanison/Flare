        <h5 class="Heading1">External Learning</h5>
        <p>Remember the “Other learning” type catalogue items you set up at the beginning to allow users to record learning that happens outside the CLS? This is where you use them.</p>
        <p>When you click in the box, a list of catalogue items that contain *only* an “Other Learning” asset will appear. Choose the ones that you would like the users to use when recording their external learning.</p>
        <p class="p_5">
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Learning Plans/External Learning.png" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>The catalogue items you choose here will appear to the users as:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Learning Plans/Learning Plans Introduction_1.png" class="img_1" />
        </p>
        <p>If you think you’ve created an Other Learning catalogue item but you can’t see it here, check the following:</p>
        <ol start="1" class="ol_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph">Is it actually in the catalogue, not just a learning asset?</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">Did you check “Allow learner to link to learning plan entry” in the Other Learning set-up? If you didn’t, it won’t be visible to you.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">Is there another learning asset in the same catalogue item as the Other Learning asset? If so, it won’t be visible to you here. The Other Learning asset needs to be the only learning asset in the catalogue item for it to be used this way.</li>
        </ol>
