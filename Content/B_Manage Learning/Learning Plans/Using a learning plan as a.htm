        <h2 class="Heading2">Introduction</h2>
        <p>As a learner, the JanisonCLS learning plans give you a versatile and intuitive way to plan and record your learning.</p>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph_1">You can start from a blank learning plan or use a template that has been provided for you.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph_1">You can have more than one learning plan running concurrently if you need to.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph_1">You can choose and link courses from the JanisonCLS to help you meet your learning goals or undertake your learning outside the JanisonCLS and record it against your plan manually.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph_1">You can also use the workflow feature to facilitate the preparation and approval of your plan with and by your manager.</li>
        </ul>

                <p>Learning plans function like any other catalogue item in the JanisonCLS.</p>
                <p>If you have already been enrolled in a learning plan by your administrator, you will see it under My Learning. Click on the relevant tile to enter your plan.</p>

                </p>
                <p>If you haven’t already been enrolled, you can select a learning plan to enrol in from the catalogue. Go to “Browse Learning” and select the appropriate catalogue item. </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/Learning Plans/Using a learning plan as a_1.png"  />
                </p>
                <p>Once you have enrolled, you will see your learning plan in your My Learning tab.</p>
                <p>Remember, you can enrol in more than one learning plan from the catalogue, you just can’t enrol in the same plan a second time until you have completed your first enrolment.</p>

                <h3 class="Heading3">The main screen</h3>
                <p>When you first open your plan, you will see this screen</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/Learning Plans/Using a learning plan as a_2.png"  />
                </p>
                <p>Your screen may not have all these features as your admin may have disabled some of them. Read below for details.</p>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Introduction:</span> If there is introductory text, it has been provided by your organisation to help you understand how they would like you to use learning plans. Take a moment to read it. </p>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Goals:</span> This is a free text field for you to outline, at a high level, what your goals and direction are for this plan. Click in it to edit it. When you’re happy with your changes, click the green tick on the right or just click on another control and the text will save.</p>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Dates:</span> You may not see these if your admin has disabled them. These are the start and end dates of your plan. Depending on what permissions your admin has allowed, you may be stuck with these dates or you may be able to edit them. Try to change them and, if you’re not allowed to edit them, you won’t be able to save your changes.</p>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Learning Plan Entries:</span> If you started from a blank plan, there will be nothing here but the words “No entries to show”. If you started from a template, there may be some entries here. These are the specific learning objectives that you have for this plan. </p>
                <ul class="ul_2">
                    <li class="ListParagraph_1">You can add learning plan entries using the button.&#160; See below for details on how to do this.</li>
                    <li class="ListParagraph_1">If you would like to edit existing entries, use the pencil icon on the top right of the tile.</li>
                    <li class="ListParagraph_1">If you would like to delete an entry, click the pencil in the top right to edit then select “Delete” in the bottom left. If “Delete” is missing, it has been disabled by your administrator.</li>
                    <li class="ListParagraph_1">“Log External Learning” on the bottom right of the tile allows you to record learning you’ve done outside the JanisonCLS. See below for details on how to do this. If this option is missing, your administrator has disabled it.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Comment:</span> This is a journal that is specific to this plan. Only you and your nominated managers can see what you write in this journal. You can use it for any purpose you like, including:</p>
                <ul class="ul_2">
                    <li class="ListParagraph_1">Recording comments or reflections on any learning you’ve undertaken</li>
                    <li class="ListParagraph_1">Exchanging comments with your manager on the progress of your learning plan</li>
                    <li class="ListParagraph_1">Uploading documents such as your CV, a referee’s report or something else of relevance to you.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Status:</span> This allows you to complete you plan, roll your plan over or send your plan to your manager for approval. If this is missing, your admin has disabled it.</p>
                <p>If you complete your plan, you may not be able to edit it again so make sure you really want to complete a plan.</p>
                <p>If you roll a plan over, you will get a new plan using the same learning plan template. Any learning plan entries that are incomplete will be copied over into your new learning plan.</p>

                <p><span class="Emphasis">Learning Objective:</span> You must fill in this field. It is a description that is meaningful to you about what your objective is. It might be something like “Improve my customer service skills” or “Achieve level 2 professional accreditation”. It can be whatever you like. The important thing is not to have two the same – it will cause you grief later.</p>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Planned Activities:</span> This is a free text field for you to outline, in a way that makes sense to you (and your manager) what you will do to achieve the objective you’ve set. You are not linking specific courses here; that part comes later.</p>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Tags</span><span class="Emphasis">:</span> This control may not be visible (the administrator can choose to disable it) but, if it is, you will need to choose which professional standards (or similar) this objective relates to. Choose one or more from the drop down.</p>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Catalogue Items:</span> This control may not be visible (the administrator can choose to disable it). If it is visible, you can choose any item from the catalogue to link to this entry. When you do this, your completion of the item and any CPD points you gain for it will be recorded in your learning plan. Note that choosing them here does not automatically enrol you in the relevant course.</p>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Planned Completion</span><span class="Emphasis">:</span> When do you think you’ll achieve this objective by?</p>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Completed</span><span class="Emphasis"> Date:</span> When did you actually achieve the objective? If you put a date into this field, the learning plan entry status will go to “Completed”</p>
                <p>Once you have completed this form and saved your changes, the details will appear on a Learning Plan Entries tile in the main screen. From there, you can link external learning to this entry.</p>

                <p>When you go to a course or undertake other study or relevant professional development (such as attending a conference), you can record that in your learning plan.</p>
                <p>Before you can record it, you need to have a learning plan entry to record it against. If you don’t have one, create one (see above for how to do this).</p>
