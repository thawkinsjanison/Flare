        <p><b>Require Resubmission</b> will unlock the attempt for the Learner so that they are able to make changes.</p>

        </p>
        <p><b>Mark Assignment Submission</b> will open options for marking, as seen below. It will put the Assignment in a Status of <i>Marking</i>. </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
            <li>If the <b>Score</b> entered here is less than the Passmark the Learner will fail the Assignment. To pass the Learner a mark equal to or greater than the Passmark must be entered.</li>
            <li>The <b>Comment</b> field is private and anything entered here will not be available to the Learner.</li>
            <li>The <b>Competency or Competencies</b> awarded to the Learner for the submission must be selected here. If the Assignment is set to award Competencies automatically these values will not be editable. </li>
            <li><b>Save Score</b> will not finalise the marking and further edits will be possible.</li>
            <li><b>Finalise</b> will complete the marking and change the status to <i>Pass</i> or <i>Fail</i>. A confirmation pop-up will give the marker the option to continue or cancel marking.</li>
        </ol>
