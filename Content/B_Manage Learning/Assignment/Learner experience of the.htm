        <h1 class="Heading1">Learner experience of the Assignment</h1>
        <p>The Learner will access the assignment the same way that they will access any other learning asset. This is usually by browsing to <b>My Learning</b> and launching the assignment from the tile. </p>

        </p>
        <p>The experience will be slightly different depending on the configuration of the assignment as covered in the previous section. In this example the assignment is configured as below.</p>

        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
            <li>On first visit the Status will be Not Submitted. This will change as the Learner progresses through the assignment.</li>
            <li>The Learner can enter text as well as upload files to the post.</li>
            <li>If the option to manually assign competencies is checked as covered in the previous section, the Learner will need to select the competencies they are applying for with the post.</li>
            <li>The Learner can make one or more posts. </li>
            <li>When ready the Learner can browse to the Actions dropdown and send the assignment to the marker For Review or Make a Submission. Either of the submission types will lock the assignment from further posts.</li>
        </ol>
