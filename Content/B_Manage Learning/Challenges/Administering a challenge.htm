        <h1>Administering a challenge</h1>
        <h2>Add to catalogue</h2>
        <p>Like all Learning assets, a challenge needs to be added to a Catalogue item to allow users to access the challenge.</p>
        <p>Refer to <a href="../Manage Catalogue1/Manage Catalogue introduction.htm">Learning &gt; Manage Catalogue</a> for details on how to create Catalogue items.</p>
        <p>When you create the catalogue item it is recommended that you enter a good description that includes the details of the prize, for example, is it the first person only who gets a prize or everyone who completes within the timeframe. Also include any criteria you might consider, like the best comment or the highest rated item that was shared.</p>
        <p class="spnote">Any points put into the catalogue item will be ignored in favour of the points from the challenge.</p>
        <h2>Advertise / promote your challenge</h2>
        <h3>Assign learning</h3>
        <p>If you would like to add users to the challenge yourself, browse to <b>Learning</b> &gt; <b>Assign Learning</b> and follow the Assign Learning wizard to enrol users into the challenge. For the best result, make sure to select <img src="../../Resources/Images/Challenges/Administering a challenge.png" style="border: none" /> in the Assign Learning wizard to notify learners that they are participating in a challenge.</p>
        <h3>Private versus Public challenges</h3>
        <p>Consider if you want your challenge to be private and only available to invited users or public and open to all users. You can also set up your catalogue item with the challenge but leave the catalogue item set to private until you are ready to release the challenge.</p>
        <h2>Reporting on your challenge</h2>
        <p>Progress reports on a challenge are done using Custom Reports. For more information on Custom Reports refer to <a href="../Customisable Reports/Customisable reports introduction.htm"><b>Learning</b> &gt; <b>Customisable Reports</b></a>.</p>
