        <h1 class="Heading1">How CPD looks and works for the User</h1>
        <p>Once you have created your CPD plan and memberships the users can log into the system and in Browse Learning can view what items are available to achieve the required CPD Points.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Seeing how many Points a catalogue item will award the user</h2>
        <p>Each catalogue item that has Points attached will show the total number of Points available on the tile in the Browse Learning screen.</p>

        </p>
        <p>If the Learner hovers the mouse over the Points icon and text, the breakdown of Points by tag will be shown.</p>

        <h2 class="Heading2">My Learning</h2>
        <p>When CPD is enabled, the My Learning screen gets split into two areas, the normal Learning Tiles area and an extra area for Other tiles. There are one or two CPD tiles included in this area, depending on your role.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
            <li>My CPD tile. This tile shows for Users with a CPD Plan. At a glance the tile shows circular graphs with the CPD Status. In the below image the Learner has achieved the Clinical Points but has not achieved the Non Clinical or CTP Mandatory Points. Keep in mind that they are compliant because they start the plan fully compliant. They will only become non-compliant when the plan date ends and they have not achieved the Points.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/CPD1/How CPD looks and works for_2.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>Clicking the tile takes the User to see the CPD Plan and status in more detail.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/CPD1/How CPD looks and works for_3.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 18pt;" start="2">
            <li>My Staff CPD tile – This tile will only be visible to Managers of Users. It shows the Manager the CPD details of the Users they are managing. At a glance the tile shows a circular graph with the CPD Status, and an overview of their Users’ compliance. In the screenshot below this User managers 2 people and they are both compliant.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/CPD1/How CPD looks and works for_4.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>Clicking the tile takes the User to a screen where they can view and manage their Users’ CPD and status in more detail. This tile is a shortcut to <b>Manage Learning</b> &gt; <b>Manage CPD progress</b>.</p>
        <p>

        <h2 class="Heading2">Enrolment in CPD Catalogue Items</h2>
        <p>Users can be manually enrolled in CPD Catalogue Items and/or CPD Catalogue Items can be setup to appear under ‘Browse Learning’ where users can self-enrol into the Catalogue Items. </p>
        <p>Users that are self-enrolling will need to view their ‘My CPD Plan’ to determine which Tags are needed to complete their CPD. Users will then need to see the Tags associated with the Catalogue Items in the ‘Browse Learning’ area so they can determine which Catalogue Items to enrol in.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Adjusting CPD Points per enrolment</h2>
        <p>If the administrator needs to adjust the number of Points a user has earned (or self-assigned) for a catalogue item, this is done through Enrolments.</p>
        <p>Go to <b>Manage Learning</b> &gt; <b>Enrolments</b>.</p>
        <p>Search for the enrolment that is to be edited.</p>
        <p>Click the <img src="../../Resources/Images/CPD1/How CPD looks and works for_6.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />icon to the right of the enrolment title</p>
        <p>Click the pencil icon next to Points. The screen will look like this</p>
