        <h1 class="Heading1">Continuing Professional Development - Introduction</h1>
        <p><b>Continuing Professional Development</b> (CPD) is a system by which professionals update or refresh their knowledge and skills to maintain competence to practice. For example it is necessary for paramedics to meet training requirements aligned to developments in pre-hospital care. Law practitioners are also required to undertake training each year to maintain their practising certificate. CPD can involve any relevant learning activity, whether formal and structured or informal and self-directed. An important concept of CPD is that the participant achieves their qualification outside of the CPD plan. The goal of the CPD plan is to ensure that they maintain their compliance by continuously undertaking training.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">How does CPD work in the CLS?</h2>
        <p>The CLS can successfully track, maintain and report on a user's CPD progress.</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Users are linked to a CPD Plan. The Plan specifies the required points the user need to achieve to meet the requirement to become compliant.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Points are assigned to Catalogue Items and when each Catalogue Item is completed by the user the linked Points are achieved by the user.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Once all the points in the Plan have been achieved the user becomes compliant.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>The CPD feature has several dependencies that need to be setup prior to allocating or undergoing CPD:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Tags are used to name the Points. An example of a <b>Tag</b> for a paramedic CPD point is <b>Clinical</b>.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">CPD plans are made up of sets of requirements and are linked to users to make them aware of what they need to do to become compliant. CPD plans are covered in more detail further down but if you would like to have a preview you will find the details <a href="CPD Plans.htm#_CPD_Plans"><span class="Hyperlink">here</span></a>.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Points are allocated to Tags in the CPD plan putting a name and number to requirements.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) should be enabled as points can be assigned to users if they are achieved outside of their current employment.</li>
        </ul>
