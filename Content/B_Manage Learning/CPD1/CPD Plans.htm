        <p>CPD Plans allow you to design the CPD requirements and allocate the Plan to specific users within the system. For example a CPD Plan for a lawyer will differ to a CPD Plan for a paramedic. The CPD requirements are set by selecting Tags and specifying how many Points a user must reach to satisfy the requirement and in what time frame they have to achieve this. It is important to remember that when a Learner is assigned to the CPD Plan they are deemed as starting the Plan as Compliant. The goal of the Plan is to ensure that they maintain this compliance by continuously undertaking training.</p>
