        <h2 class="Heading2">What Points are required?</h2>
        <p>A CPD Plan requires learners to achieve Points by completing Learning from different categories. In the CLS the categories are defined using Tags.</p>
        <p>This section of the CPD plan form allows you to select any number of tags, and the minimum number of Points that a learner must obtain from each tag during the CPD period.</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">In the Tags field drop-down select the <b>tag</b> you would like to add to the plan. You can add as many tags as needed. Click the <b>Add</b> button to add it to the plan. Note that only the tags in the Tag Types you specified in <b>Settings</b> &gt; <b>Points Settings</b> will appear here. If there are no tags in the drop down, go back to <b>Settings</b> &gt; <b>Points Settings</b> and make sure the right Tag Types is present in the drop-down there.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Enter the <b>Minimum Points</b> for each tag, this is the minimum number of Points that a User must obtain in the plan period.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Enter the <b>Total Points</b> required which is calculated from above tags.</li>

        <p>Note that the <b>Total Points</b> shows the overall percentage completed in the chart and total Points below the chart. The chart is covered later in the document. The chart only shows completed when all tags are completed and all Points obtained</p>

        </ul>

        <h2 class="Heading2">Rollover Membership</h2>
        <p>This feature allows you to refresh the CPD Plan Membership for a new period and gives you the option to set a start date for the new plan. Setting the new plan will complete the currently active membership and a new membership will be created. Be careful as this cannot be undone. </p>
        <p>The purpose of this feature is to create a new membership for the user if users need to continuously meet their CPD requirements. With professions such as paramedics and lawyers, training is ongoing.</p>
        <p>The old plan membership can be viewed on the current plan membership details page in the section called Membership History.</p>
