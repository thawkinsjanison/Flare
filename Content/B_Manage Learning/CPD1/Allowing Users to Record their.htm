        <h1 class="Heading1">Allowing Users to Record their own CPD Points</h1>
        <p>Many times, a professional will complete learning outside the Janison CLS. They might, for example, attend a seminar or workshop, collaborate on an academic paper, or complete a course at another training organisation. When they do this training, they can record the fact of that learning, and how many points that learning is worth, in the Janison CLS. There are two features in the system that allow users to record their own CPD points:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Other Learning</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Learning Plans</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Adding Points from Other Learning</h2>
        <p>How to set this up for the user:</p>
        <p>Go to <b>Manage Learning</b> &gt; <b>Manage Learning Assets</b> &gt; <b>Add Learning Asset</b>.</p>
        <p>Select <b>New Other Learning</b> from the list.</p>
        <p>Complete the fields and then scroll down until you can see this part of the screen</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/CPD1/Allowing Users to Record their.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>Tick the “<b>Requires Points</b>” tick box.</p>
        <p>If you are using learning plans (see the Learning Plans instructions for how), you will also need to tick the <b>Allow learner to link a learning plan entry</b> tick box.</p>
        <p>If you would like the opportunity for someone to review the learner’s self-accredited points, select a verification option from the Verification Settings.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Catalogue item for Other Learning</h2>
        <p>As with all learning assets, Other Learning will require a catalogue item for the Learner to enrol in. Two set-ups are not supported with Other learning:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
            <li>The catalogue item must only contain a single Component of Other Learning. If more than one component is added to the Catalogue item the points assigned by the Learner will be ignored.&#160; In this scenario a warning will appear notifying you of the limitation.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/CPD1/Allowing Users to Record their_1.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="2">
            <li>Points should not be added to the catalogue item containing the Other Learning as the points applied to the Other Learning will then be ignored. A warning notifying you of this will appear if points are applied to the Catalogue item.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/CPD1/Allowing Users to Record their_2.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>If you’ve created an Other Learning type catalogue item (see above), then users can use an enrolment in this to record learning that they undertake outside the JanisonCLS.</p>
        <p>From <b>Browse Learning</b> They can select the <b>Other Learning</b> catalogue item and enrol.</p>
        <p>Clicking the <b>Launch Other Learning</b> button will take them to a screen where they can enter a variety of information about the learning they’ve done (for more information, refer to the Other Learning user instructions).</p>
        <p>To add points, the user populates the points against any Category as shown below in the screenshot.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/CPD1/Allowing Users to Record their_3.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Adding Points from Learning Plans</h2>
        <p>If the user is enrolled in a Learning Plan and that Learning Plan allows external learning to be recorded (refer to the Learning Plan instructions for how to set this up) then the <b>Log external learning</b> option will open the same user interface as above for the learner to record points.</p>
