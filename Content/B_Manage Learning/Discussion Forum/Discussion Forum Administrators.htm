        <h2 class="Heading2">Making a role available in the Role dropdown.</h2>
        <p>This is a one off setting that needs to be made to make the facilitator role appear in the Role dropdown of the Discussion Forum Administrators section.&#160; Without setting this the Role dropdown may be empty.</p>
        <p>Browse to Settings &gt; Roles and open the role Facilitator.</p>
        <p>In the Applicable Documents section check Discussion Forum as shown below.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Administrators will appear in the right hand column of the Discussion Forum.&#160; They will have an&#160;Edit Pencil&#160;to make changes to all posts in the forum.&#160; Hiding a post by clicking the eye will hide it from all participants.&#160; A participant will also see these icons but they will only be able to make edits to their own posts and hiding a post will only hide it from themselves, not all participants.</p>
