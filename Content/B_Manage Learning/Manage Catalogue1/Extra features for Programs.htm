        <p>As we saw in the <a href="Manage Catalogue introduction.htm">introduction</a>, <b>Programs</b> are <b>Catalogue Items</b> that have more than one linked <b>Component</b>, that is, more than one linked Learning Asset. They are functionally very similar to Catalogue Items, except in a few cases:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 0pt;" start="1">
            <li>Prerequisites within Catalogue Items require more than one Component hence can only take place within Programs, see <a href="Prerequisites within Programs.htm#933311327">Prerequisites within Programs</a>.</li>
            <li>There are some circumstance e.g. a User’s withdrawal from a Session under certain conditions, where an enrolment might be cancelled. In this case, if the linked Learning Event is the only Component in a Catalogue Item, then the whole enrolment can be cancelled. However, if the Learning Event is not the only Component (the enrolment is in a Program), then the whole enrolment cannot be cancelled as the other Learning Asset(s) still remain.</li>
            <li>Programs can become quite complex structurally so the facility to copy them by, in effect, doing a Save As operation is offered. To find this, inspect the Program and select Copy Program from the Actions drop-down list.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img class="shareWithMenu" src="../../Resources/Images/Manage Catalogue2/Extra features for Programs.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>This takes you to a <b>New Catalogue Item</b> screen with Copy appended to the old Program name and all other details and links in place. You can save your copy of the Program here with its new name.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 0pt;" start="4">
            <li>Additionally you can preview a Program in  from a learner’s point of view. To do this inspect the Program and select <b>Preview</b> from the <b>Actions</b> drop-down list.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>A separate window opens with Browse Learning and your Program displayed ready to test.</p>
