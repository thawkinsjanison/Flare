        <h2 class="Heading2">Available for Guest users</h2>
        <p>This feature should not be used without consulting with Janison support services as it is only intended for very specific requirements. As no progress will be accessible for the user it is recommended that the <b>Instalaunch</b>&#160;link&#160;feature is used instead.&#160;</p>

        <h2 class="Heading2">Notifications</h2>
        <p>If checked this setting will trigger an email notification to managers when learners self-enrol. The <a href="../../D_Settings/Message templates1/Message templates introduction.htm">Message Template</a> used for this notification is Enrolment-ManagerConfirmation.</p>

        </p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Expiry</h2>
        <p>Set an expiry date if the learning expires after some time, and learners must re-do it in order to keep their learning up to date.</p>
        <p> <img src="../../Resources/Images/Manage Catalogue2/Catalogue Item Additional_3.png" /></p>
        <p>Expiry dates can be reported on using the Customisable reports feature. The learner will see the expiry date on the catalogue tile when they access their My Learning page.</p>

        <h2 class="Heading2">Access After Completion</h2>
        <p>Sometimes it can be important to restrict the amount of time that a learner has to access content after they complete it. It is therefore possible to restrict access to content after a specified time.</p>
