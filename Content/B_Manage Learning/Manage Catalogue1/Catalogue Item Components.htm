        <p>Learning Assets are added to the Catalogue item in this section.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 11pt;" start="1">
            <li>Search for and select a Learning Asset from the list of Learning Assets. Click the + icon to add it to the Catalogue Item.</li>
            <li>If a Catalogue Item contains multiple components the components can optionally have <b>prerequisites</b>, see <a href="Prerequisites within Programs.htm#_Prerequisites_within_Programs"><span class="Hyperlink">Prerequisites within Catalogue Items</span></a>.</li>
            <li>The <b>Weight</b> is the relative importance of the component. <ul style="list-style-type: disc;"><li style="list-style-type: disc;">This can be used to make a component optional. If the Weight = 0 then the component does not need to be completed for the Catalogue Item to be completed.&#160; </li><li style="list-style-type: disc;">Alternatively use this value to make one component’s Test to be worth more for a learner’s mark than another component’s Test.</li><li style="list-style-type: disc;">Component weight can also be used as an indicator of relative load for learners, so a component taking 5 minutes would be a smaller percentage and a 3 hour course would be larger percentage.</li></ul></li>
        </ol>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 11pt;" start="4">
            <li><b>Share Progress</b> accommodates the situation where, for example, the same Learning Asset appears in two Catalogue Items. If a learner is enrolled in both Catalogue Items and both components for the identical Learning Asset have been set to Share Progress, then there is one progress record for that Learning Asset. Thus the learner’s progress in the Learning Asset in one Catalogue Item is reflected in their progress for that Learning Asset in the other Catalogue Item. This would not otherwise be the case.</li>
            <li>Click the icons under <b>Actions</b> to drag a component up or down in the list or to delete it altogether</li>
