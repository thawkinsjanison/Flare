        <h1 class="Heading1">Catalogue Items and Prerequisites </h1>
        <p>Prerequisites are items that must be completed before enrolment in a particular learning entity is permitted. The CLS supports prerequisites at two levels:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 0pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Between Catalogue Items.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Within a Catalogue Item.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Prerequisites <b>between</b> Catalogue Items are managed using Prerequisite Groups such that a Catalogue Item can have one or more Prerequisite Groups attached to it. A learner must complete at least one Item from each of these groups before s/he can enrol in the Catalogue Item. Note that these only apply when a learner self-enrols, see <a href="Prerequisites between Catalogue.htm#_Prerequisites_between_Catalogue">Prerequisites between Catalogue Items</a>.</p>
        <p>Pre-requisites <b>within</b> a Catalogue Items are attached to the components within it. A learner cannot start a particular component until its prerequisite components have been completed.</p>
        <p>In the diagram below prerequisites between Catalogues can be visualised on the left and prerequisites within a Catalogue Item can be visualised on the right. A learner must complete either Catalogue Item A or Catalogue Item B in group 1, as well as Catalogue Item C in group 2 before s/he can enrol in Program D. Once enrolled in D, s/he must complete Component 1 before Component 3 can be launched. Component 4 awaits the completion of both Components 1 and 2. And Component 5 awaits the completion of Component 4.</p>

        <p>Prerequisites make it possible to design sophisticated and flexible learning programs that build knowledge and skills in a structured and controlled manner. With prerequisite groups, you can allow learners to do Course A or Course B as a prerequisite. This can be useful if the two courses are equivalent for prerequisite purposes or if you have an old version of a course that people can no longer enrol in but which still counts as having met a prerequisite requirement.</p>
