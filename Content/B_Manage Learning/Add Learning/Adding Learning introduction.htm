        <h1>Adding Learning – introduction</h1>
        <p>In the CLS a Learning Asset is essentially a vessel of information: an intellectual property that helps Users learn or that tests their understanding. Learning Assets can take many forms including Courses, Modules, documents, videos, Learning Events, Tests and much more, see <a href="../Manage Learning Assets1/Types of Learning Assets.htm">Types of Learning Asset</a>.</p>
        <p>A Learning Asset can be integrated into the Janison CLS in a number of ways:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>It can be created within the CLS using the functionality available through the Design menu (i.e. creating Courses, Modules, Pages, Tests, Questions, etc.). </li>
            <li>It can be created outside the CLS and imported into the CLS (e.g. a SCORM course)</li>
            <li>It can take place outside the system and be monitored inside the system (e.g. face to face events, called Sessions and Learning Events)</li>
            <li>It can occur outside the CLS but be linked into the CLS (e.g. Other Learning)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These types of learning can be added to the CLS system using various methods:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Semi-automatic: the <strong>Add Learning</strong> wizard described here works with categories 2-4 (above) of the list above. This wizard creates a new Learning Asset and puts it into a new Catalogue Item.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Manual: use <strong>Manage Learning &gt; Manage Learning Asset &gt; Add Learning Asset</strong> to add all types of Learning Asset, see <a href="../../B_Manage Learning/Manage Learning Assets1/Learning Assets introduction.htm">Manage Learning Assets</a>.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Manual: use <strong>Design &gt; Courses &gt; Add Course</strong> to add a new Course, see <a href="../../C_Design/courses2/Courses Introduction.htm">Courses </a></li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Manual: use <strong>Manage Learning &gt; Manage Sessions &gt; Add Learning Event</strong> to add a new Learning Event, see <a href="../../B_Manage Learning/Manage Sessions2/Managing Sessions Introduction.htm">Manage Sessions</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note that</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Users cannot actually enrol in a Learning Asset until it is linked to a Catalogue Item. The Add Learning wizard creates a new Learning Asset and then creates a new, linked Catalogue Item so that Users can enrol.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">a Catalogue Item that contains more than one Learning Asset becomes known as a Program but remains functionally the same (see <a href="../Manage Catalogue1/Extra features for Programs.htm">Programs</a>). Thus, references to Catalogue Items here also include Programs.</li>
        </ul>
