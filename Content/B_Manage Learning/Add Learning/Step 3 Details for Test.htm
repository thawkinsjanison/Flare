        <h1 class="Heading1">Step 3 Details for Test</h1>
        <p>Tests in the CLS are made up of Questions. Tests also include settings about how the Test is to be timed, marked, randomised, ordered and delivered. Further information about assessment Tests is found at <a href="file://janison/shares/ClientServices/Documentation/C_Design/Assessment Module Tests/Tests Introduction.htm"><a href="../../C_Design/Assessment Module Tests/Tests Introduction.htm"><span class="Hyperlink">Assessment Tests</span></a></a>.</p>
        <p>Tests can play a number of roles in the CLS. They can be part of learning activities and are very important in assessment activities. The Add Learning wizard creates assessment Tests.</p>
        <p>The wizard simplifies the process and makes it easy to create an enrollable Assessment Test. It selects the default Discipline and creates a new Assessment Module, in addition to the new Catalogue Item that it creates for every type of Learning Asset. Note also that:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">question banking is disabled (you cannot reuse Questions across Tests).</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">you cannot search for pre-existing Questions to add to the Test.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">when you unlink a Question from the Test, this deletes the Question, not just the link.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In this screen you enter all the information about the Test and its linked Questions.</p>
