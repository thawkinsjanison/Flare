        <h1>Add Learning</h1>
        <p>Add Learning is a wizard, i.e. a setup assistant that offers you a series of dialog boxes to complete the steps required to create an enrollable Learning Asset in the CLS. </p>
        <p>The wizard creates the Learning Asset and also puts it into a new Catalogue Item with the same name, so that it is possible for Users to enrol in it. </p>
        <p>Note that as an alternative to using the wizard, there are manual methods to create Learning Assets, e.g. through <strong><a href="../Manage Learning Assets1/Add Learning Asset.htm">Manage Learning &gt; Manage Learning Assets &gt; Add Learning Asset</a></strong>. The manual methods do not link to a Catalogue Item with the same name, as happens using the wizard.</p>
        <p>There are a many types of learning in the CLS, see <a href="../../B_Manage Learning/Manage Learning Assets1/Types of Learning Assets.htm">Types of Learning Asset</a>.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>A number of these types of learning can be added to the CLS system via the wizard. They are:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;"><strong>Learning Event</strong>: made up of one or more Sessions where a user must attend a venue</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;"><strong>Other Learning</strong>: external learning already undertaken by a User</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;"><strong>Program</strong>: a Catalogue Item containing more than one Learning Asset</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;"><strong>SCORM Course</strong>: a course created in a 3rd party application such as Lectora and Captivate</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;"><strong>Trackable Document</strong> - a document used to deliver learning material in PDF, Audio, or Video formats</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If it has been enabled in the Test Designer settings, you can also create a:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;"><strong>Test</strong>: a container for Questions</li>
            <p>Note that the wizard simplifies the process to make creating an enrollable Test easy. The default Discipline is selected and a new Assessment Module is also created (in addition to the new Catalogue Item that the wizard creates for every type of Learning Asset). </p>
            <p>Note also that:</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                <li style="list-style-type: disc;"> question banking is disabled (you cannot reuse Questions across tests).</li>
                <li style="list-style-type: disc;"> you cannot search for pre-existing Questions to add to a Test.</li>
                <li style="list-style-type: disc;"> when you unlink a Question from a Test this deletes the Question, not just the link.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>Depending on what has been configured by Janison in your settings for Learning Assets, the wizard may also create:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;"><strong>Assessment Events</strong>:  Assessment at a specific time and place</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;"><strong>Lti Events</strong>: learning at a completely separate website that the CLS links to </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Add Learning wizard can be accessed from two locations.</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Select <strong>Manage Learning &gt; Manage Catalogue &gt; Add Learning Wizard</strong>, or</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Add Learning1/Add Learning_1.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Select <strong>Manage Learning &gt; Add Learning</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Add Learning1/Add Learning_2.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>Note that if you discontinue the wizard before you complete all the steps, a Catalogue Item and Learning Asset are both created. You can locate them through <strong>Manage Learning &gt; Manage Catalogue</strong>. You will find the Catalogue Item listed amongst the items with Draft status. After selecting it you can edit both the item and the asset.</p>
