        <h1>Step 4 Review/Publish</h1>
        <p>You may recall that Users cannot actually enrol in a Learning Asset until it is linked to a Catalogue Item. Thus, after Steps 2-3 the Add Learning wizard has created a new Learning Asset and also a new, linked Catalogue Item with the same name as the Learning Asset.</p>
        <p>The last screen, the <strong>Review/Publish </strong>screen, offers you the option to publish the Catalogue Item as private or public. Alternatively, you can edit any details before publishing by selecting the <strong>Go Back </strong>button.</p>
        <p>To complete the wizard click <strong>Publish</strong> and choose one of the following:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Selecting <strong>Publish as private</strong> will create the Learning Asset and Catalogue Item but they will be hidden from Users.<strong> Manage Catalogue </strong>will show the Catalogue Item as <em>Not in Catalogue.</em></li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Selecting <strong>Publish as public</strong> will make the Learning Asset and Catalogue Item visible to Users. <strong>Manage Catalogue </strong>will show the Catalogue Item as <em>Available in Catalogue.</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>After you publish, you are taken to the <strong>Manage Catalogue</strong> section. You are at the inspection screen for your Catalogue Item where you can inspect various values and add others, see Inspect Catalogue Item details.</p>
        <p>Note that if you discontinue the wizard before you complete the last step, a Catalogue Item and Learning Asset are both created. You can locate them through <strong>Manage Learning &gt; Manage Catalogue</strong> where you will find the Catalogue Item listed amongst the items with <em>Draft</em> status. After clicking it you can edit both the item and the asset.</p>
