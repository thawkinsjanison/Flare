        <h1 class="Heading1">Attaching Certificates to Catalogue items</h1>
        <p>You attach a Certificate to a Catalogue Item when you are creating or editing it. The certificates generated by the CLS will be based on the template that you specify here.</p>
        <p>When you click the checkbox next to Has Certificate extra fields pop up. The default template or the template specified in Settings for the Learning Asset in the Catalogue Item is displayed here. You can use that or alternatively you can select another template using Select files.</p>

        </p>
        <p>A Certificate’s number can be modified by entering text in the field Certificate Code, see below. </p>
        <p>Note that a Program is a Catalogue Item containing more than one Learning Asset. You can only have one Certificate per Program/Catalogue Item, thus Users will not receive a Certificate for each of the Learning Assets in a Program.</p>
