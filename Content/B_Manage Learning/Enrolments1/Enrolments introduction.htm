        <h1>Enrolments introduction</h1>
        <p>There are a number of different types of Learning Assets in the CLS, see <a href="../../B_Manage Learning/Manage Learning Assets1/Types of Learning Assets.htm">Learning Assets</a>. Each type needs to be linked to a Catalogue Item in order for learner Users to enrol or be enrolled in it. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Manage Catalogue1/Manage Catalogue introduction.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;border-left-style: none;border-left-width: 1px;border-left-color: #a9a9a9;border-right-style: none;border-right-width: 1px;border-right-color: #a9a9a9;border-top-style: none;border-top-width: 1px;border-top-color: #a9a9a9;border-bottom-style: none;border-bottom-width: 1px;border-bottom-color: #a9a9a9;" />
        </p>
        <p>A Users can be enrolled in Catalogue Items by other authorised Users using several methods. These methods create a User Enrolment in the Catalogue Item(s). The methods include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Manual: e.g. enrolling Users in a particular Catalogue Item, see <a href="../../B_Manage Learning/Assign Learning/Assign Learning Catalogue.htm#">Assign Learning – Catalogue Item</a>.</li>
            <li>Semi-automatic: using the Assign Learning wizard to enrol Users in one or more Catalogue Items, see <a href="../../B_Manage Learning/Assign Learning/Assigning Learning introduction.htm">Assign Learning</a>.</li>
            <li>Importing Enrolments data. Note that this method also allows the Enrolment Status to be set to a variety of values. see <a href="Import Learning History.htm#_Import_learning_history"><span class="Hyperlink">Import Learning H</span><span class="Hyperlink">istory</span></a></li>
            <li>Creating and running User Enrolment Rules that select specific Users and automatically enrol them in specific Catalogue Items, in <strong>Settings &gt; User Enrolment Rules</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>A Catalogue Item can also be set up so that it is self-enrolling, i.e. learner Users can enrol themselves. See Manage Catalogue - Self-Enrolment Settings for details of how to set this up. </p>
        <p>In much of the Enrolments section of the CLS, authorised Users do not actually add Enrolments, but rather they search for, inspect, modify and delete existing Enrolments. </p>
        <p>They can view</p>
        <ul>
            <li>User details</li>
            <li>the Catalogue item the User is enrolled in</li>
            <li>creation date of the Enrolment</li>
            <li>completion date of the Enrolment</li>
            <li>status of the Enrolment</li>
            <li>attempts of the Enrolment</li>
            <li>progress details of the Enrolment (via View More)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Enrolments are created in the Enrolments section through <a href="Import Learning History.htm#_Import_learning_history"><span class="Hyperlink">Import Learning H</span><span class="Hyperlink">istory</span></a> and through Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) if it has previously been activated, see <a href="RPL.htm#_RPL"><span class="Hyperlink">RPL</span></a>. Additionally, adding Enrolments to a Catalogue Item through Manage Catalogues actually brings you back to the Enrolments section with that Catalogue Item, see <a href="../../B_Manage Learning/Assign Learning/Assign Learning Catalogue.htm#">Assign Learning – Catalogue Item</a> but you cannot get directly from Enrolments to this screen.</p>
        <p>Note that a Catalogue Item that contains more than one Learning Asset (either at its creation or after editing it) remains functionally the same but becomes a Program (see Manage Catalogue). Thus, subsequent references to Catalogue Items also include Programs.</p>
