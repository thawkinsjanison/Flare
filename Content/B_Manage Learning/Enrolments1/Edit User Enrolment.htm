        <h1>Edit User Enrolment </h1>
        <p>Sometimes it is necessary for an administrator or authorised staff member to delete a User Enrolment or to edit User Enrolment details, e.g. to check Competency progress or to add a Competency (if, for example, a User completed a Catalogue Item before the Competency was attached to it).</p>
        <p>To edit a User Enrolment select <strong>Manage Learning &gt; Enrolment</strong>s, locate the required User Enrolment and click the <strong>View More</strong> icon </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Enrolments1/View More about an Enrolment.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>The next screen shows the enrolment details for the User Enrolment in the Catalogue Item</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The dates, comments and points involved can all be edited in this screen</li>
            <li>Competency can be added to this Enrolment: select each Competency and click the <strong>plus</strong> icon to add it</li>
            <li>Click <strong>Save Enrolment</strong> to save these updates</li>
            <li>To delete the entire Enrolment click <strong>Delete Enrolment</strong> then click <strong>Yes</strong> in the dialogue box. The Enrolment has now been removed from the Catalogue Item. Note that deleting an Enrolment for a User will also remove their progress for the Learning Asset.</li>
        </ol>
