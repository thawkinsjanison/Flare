        <h1 class="Heading1">Managing and Inspecting Tags</h1>
        <p>The CLS allows administrators to inspect Tags and check the items they are attached to. To inspect Tags select <strong>Manage Learning &gt; Manage Tags</strong>.</p>
        <ol start="1">
            <li>The Tags screen is divided into Active and Inactive (Archived) Tags. Click the tab to see the members of that kind of Tag. </li>
            <li>Individual Tags can be located in the list or by clicking <strong>Search for Tags</strong> to search within it.</li>
            <li>The list can be ordered by Name or Update date by clicking on the heading. A black triangle indicates which of these currently determines the ordering.</li>
            <li>The information for each Tag includes the numbers of items in each relevant category in the CLS that have this Tag attached. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Each one is also a link to a list of the members of this category of items, thus making it possible to ultimately inspect and/or edit details of and enrolments in the members of this category.</p>
