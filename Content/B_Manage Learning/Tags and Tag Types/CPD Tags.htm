        <h1 class="Heading1">CPD Tags</h1>
        <p>Tags are essential for allocating Continuing Professional Development (CPD) points and must be created before the rest of the CPD setup. The purpose of Tags is to put names to the CPD Points.</p>
        <p>Tags are linked to Catalogue Items related to specific CPD topics. A User needs to complete a set number of points associated with that topic, so they choose Catalogue items with the relevant Tags.</p>
        <p>See <a href="../../B_Manage Learning/CPD1/CPD Tags.htm">Continuing Professional Development</a> for details.</p>
