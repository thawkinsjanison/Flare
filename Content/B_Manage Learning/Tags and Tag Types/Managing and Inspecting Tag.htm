        <h1 class="Heading1">Managing and Inspecting Tag Types</h1>
        <p>Tags can be grouped by Tag Type. For example, Tags such ‘Spelling’, ‘Punctuation’, ‘Grammar’, etc could be collected together and accessed via a Tag Type of ‘English’. In the example below, the Tag ‘Grammar’ has a Tag Type of ‘English:</p>

        </p>
        <p>NOTE: Although the system will permit you to create Tags without assigning them to a Tag Type, it is recommended to always assign your Tags to Tag Types. This will give you greater flexibility in certain circumstances. An example of this is you can only show Tags on the Browse Learning tile if they are linked to Tag Types.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The Manage Tag Types screen shows a list of all the Tag Types. </p>
        <ol start="1">
            <li>Individual Tag Types can be located in the list or by clicking Search for Tag Types to search within it.</li>
            <li>The list can be ordered by Name or Update date by clicking on the heading. A black triangle indicates which of these currently determines the ordering.</li>
            <li>The information for each Tag Type includes the numbers of Tags with this Tag Type.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Each one is also a link to a list of those Tags, in the same format as the Manage Tags screen. Thus, it is possible to ultimately inspect and/or edit details of and enrolments in all the learning material in the CLS with this Tag Type.</p>
        <ol start="4">
            <li>Click <strong>Add Tag Type</strong> to add a new Tag Type</li>
