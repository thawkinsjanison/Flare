        <h5>Manage Sessions – Introduction</h5>
        <p>There are a number of different types of Learning Assets in the CLS. The type of Learning Asset described here is the Learning Event. Each type of Learning Asset needs to be linked to a Catalogue Item in order for learner Users to enrol or be enrolled in it.</p>
        <p>A Learning Event is training that takes place when a learner User actually attends a venue, including a virtual venue (webinar). In the CLS, such training is called a Learning Event and there are a number of kinds of such events:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Face to face</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Conference</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Informal Session</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Lecture</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Mentoring</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Webinar</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Workshop</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A Learning Event is defined as one of these kinds of event and made up of one or more Sessions. It is the Session that a learner User attends with a date, location, capacity and facilitator. This can change from Session to Session within one Learning Event. </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>In general, the process for the learner User is:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Manage Sessions1/Manage Sessions Introduction_1.png" />
        </p>
        <p>However, the first two steps can take place in a number of ways, depending on:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Catalogue Item enrolment settings (which in turn depends on Settings &gt;Enrolment in the CLS) </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Learning Event enrolment settings </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Capacity of a Session, i.e. how many people can attend it</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When a learner User goes to Browse Learning and clicks the Catalogue Item containing the Learning Event, they see a list of all the Sessions and their details, including whether they’ve reached capacity (are full). </p>
        <p>After this, different things happen depending on the interaction of the following settings:</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>

                        <p>After either option the learner is enrolled and sees a response confirming their Session choice</p>

        <p>Learner Users are notified that they have been added to a Session or a Waitlist through the CLS. Note that if the Catalogue Item’s self-enrolment method requires approval, then the column on the right will also include the approvals process specified, see Self-Enrolment Settings</p>
        <p>A Learning Event can consist of</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">a single Session</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">multiple Sessions</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">multiple Sessions in various locations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A User enrols in one Session in a Learning Event. If a Session runs over more than one day Users are required to attend all of this time in order to complete the Session. However, one Session cannot, for example, run just in the morning for several days. If this format is required then a separate Event should be created for each morning Session so that Users can enrol in each morning Session.</p>
        <p>Sessions can be added during the creation of the Learning Event or later on. A Learning Event without Sessions can be used for registering interest or waitlisting Users, with the possibility of creating Sessions later when the training and/or interest is confirmed. A Learning Event with Sessions can be used to auto enrol Users via workflows or as above for registering interest and waitlisting Users.</p>
        <p>There are a number of different roles in the whole process and they can be done by the same or different people. They are:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">enrolling learners in an Event (if necessary)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">facilitating the Event</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">facilitating particular Sessions</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">marking attendance</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">awarding Competencies</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Sessions are created, edited, managed, marked and administered through Manage Learning &gt; Manage Sessions</p>

        <p>You cannot edit Learning Events in this part of the CLS, although you can add new events.</p>
        <p>You can create and edit Learning Events and Sessions through Manage Learning &gt; Manage Learning Assets.</p>
        <p>You can also create Learning Events and Sessions through Manage Learning &gt; Add Learning, which is a setup assistant that also creates a Catalogue Item so that Users to be enrolled.</p>
