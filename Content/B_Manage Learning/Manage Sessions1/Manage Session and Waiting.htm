        <h5>Manage Session and Waiting Lists</h5>
        <p>Once an Event and its Sessions have been created and the Event has been placed into a Catalogue Item, it is available for Users to register their interest depending on the settings, see Manage Sessions – Introduction for details.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Manage Sessions1/Manage Session and Waiting.png" />
        </p>
        <p>The Manage Session screen allows the Event facilitator to examine Session details and allocate Users to that Session. The screen displays attending Users and also the:</p>
        <p>•Session waiting list</p>
        <p>•Event waiting list</p>
        <p>Users can be moved directly from the waitlists to the Attendee list (and vice versa). When a User has been moved from a waitlist to the Session they will receive a system notification email advising them of the enrolment and Session details.</p>
        <p>To manage a Session select Manage Learning &gt; Manage Sessions. Locate the Session and click Manage. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Manage Sessions1/Manage Session and Waiting_1.png" />
        </p>
        <p>You will be taken to a screen where you can view attendees and waitlisted Users for the Event and Sessions. </p>
        <p>The main components of the screen show: </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 72pt;" start="1">
            <li>The names of the Session and its Learning Event</li>
            <li>The place and time of the Session </li>
            <li>The number of places available</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Manage Sessions1/Manage Session and Waiting_2.png" />
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 72pt;" start="4">
            <li>The list of enrolled Attendees</li>
            <li>You can delete an attendee by clicking the minus icon. S/he is moved to the Session waitlist </li>
            <li>You can sort the Attendee list by Status: click the triangle and use the sort function</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Manage Sessions1/Manage Session and Waiting_3.png" />
        </p>
        <p>There are two tabs under Waitlisted Users (the Sessions waitlist and the Event waitlist). Click a tab name to display that list. Both lists can be sorted by entering search terms in the search field and clicking Search </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 72pt;" start="7">
            <li>The Session waiting list refers to the Session you are managing</li>
            <li>The Event waiting list refers to the Learning Event attached to the Session you are managing</li>
            <li>On either list click on the plus icon to approve a User. S/he will disappear from the Waitlist and appear in the Attendee list of this Session.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Note that you do not have to save this screen for your waitlist changes to take effect.</p>
