        <h1 class="Heading1">Add a Competency Set</h1>
        <p>Sometimes you need to create a set of Competencies, such as an in-house collection of competencies. These are called <b>Competency Sets</b>.</p>
        <p>Notes</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A Competency must have already been created before it can be added to a Competency Set. Refer to <a href="Add a Competency.htm#Add"><span class="Hyperlink">Add a Competency</span></a> for instructions on how to create Competencies.</li>
            <li>Competency Sets have a defined Set Type. You can choose from the default Set Types and any other Set Types that have been created in advance. See <a href="Manage Competency Set Types.htm#ManComSetTyp"><span class="Hyperlink">Manage a Competency Set Type</span></a> for instructions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To add a Competency Set, select <b>Manage Learning &gt; Manage Competencies</b> and select <b>Add Competency Set</b> from the <b>Actions</b> dropdown. </p>
