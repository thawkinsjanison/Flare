        <h1>User experience of Competencies </h1>
        <p>Competencies achieved can be visible both to learners and to their managers.</p>
        <h2>View Competencies as a learner</h2>
        <p>To view their Competencies a learner selects <strong>My Account</strong> and follows the steps below.</p>
        <p>
            <img class="shareWithMenu" src="../../Resources/Images/Competencies/View competencies as a learner2.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <ol start="1">
            <li>Select the <strong>Competency</strong> collapsible window to open it.</li>
            <p>Three tabs appear: <b>Required</b>, <b>Enrolled</b> and <b>Achieved</b>. </p>
            <li><strong>Required</strong> lists the Competencies that are required through Competency Requirements(s). </li>
            <p>If a Competency has been acquired the Date Completed and Expiry Dates are shown and the Status icon is a tick. </p>
            <p>If it has not been completed, these dates are blank and the Status icon is red with a crossbar</p>
            <li> <strong>Enrolled</strong> lists Competencies linked to Catalogue Items the learner is or has enrolled in and their completion data.</li>
            <li><![CDATA[  ]]><strong>Achieved</strong> lists Competencies linked to Catalogue Items the learner  has completed and their completion data.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>View Competencies as a manager</h2>
        <p>Under specific circumstances a User can see the Competency Requirement status of their staff on their My Learning screen.</p>
        <p>To enable this:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> The User must be established in the system as a direct manager of these staff through a <a href="../../A_Manage People/Positions/Positions Introduction.htm">Position to Position</a> management relationship.</li>
            <li> The <b>Smart Tile</b> setting must be checked at global level for the tenant. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>When these are set, a Competency Requirement tile appears at the bottom of the screen:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Competencies/UserExperience2.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" /> </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Compliance data for all staff directly and indirectly reporting to the User is summarised on the tile.</li>
            <li><b>My Staff Competency Requirements</b> is a link to the <a href="Manage Compliance with Competency.htm">Manage Compliance with Competency</a> screen where the data is displayed in detail.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Note:</p>
        <p>If you have set this up correctly and do not see the tile, contact Support for help.</p>
