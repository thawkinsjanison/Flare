        <h1>Add a Competency Requirement</h1>
        <p>Competency Requirements are collections of Competencies that are set up so that Users are required to acquire the Competencies. Completion of the appropriate learning has to be done periodically for Competencies that are only valid for a fixed period.</p>
        <p>To manage Competency Requirements select <strong>Manage Learning &gt; Manage Competencies</strong> and select <strong>Manage Competency Requirements</strong> from the <strong>Actions</strong> dropdown.</p>
        <p>
            <img class="shareWithMenu" src="../../Resources/Images/Competencies/Add a Competency Requirement.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" /> </p>
        <p>You will be directed to the <b>Manage Competency Requirements</b> screen.</p>
        <p>To add a Competency Requirement, select <strong>Add Competency Requirement</strong> from the top of the page.</p>
        <p>
            <img class="shareWithMenu" src="../../Resources/Images/Competencies/Add a Competency Requirement_1.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>You will be directed to the <b>New Competency Requirement</b> screen.</p>
        <ol start="1">
            <li>Enter a <strong>name</strong> for the Competency Requirement. The identifier will be created automatically.</li>
            <li>Enter a short <strong>Description</strong> if desired.</li>
            <li>Check the <strong>Active</strong> box to create an active Competency Requirement.</li>
            <li>Select a User from the <strong>Primary Contact</strong> dropdown.</li>
            <li>Select the <strong>What competencies are required</strong> collapsible window to open it.</li>
            <li>Select a Competency from the dropdown and select the <b>+</b> icon. </li>
            <p>This adds the Competency to the list. You can do this multiple times.</p>
            <li>Under<strong> Which users does this rule apply to?</strong> specify the Users that this Competency Requirement applies to.</li>
            <p>Rather than selecting multiple User names from a dropdown, you create rules to define the Users who this Competency Requirement apples to. These rules are called <i>filters</i>. They can be very specifically targeted and are combined using Boolean logic. This will be best understood by someone who is comfortable with: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Boolean operations (AND, OR, NOT), </li>
                <li>its language (e.g. “!” means “NOT”), and </li>
                <li>how nesting affect scope.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Clear, detailed instructions about how to set these up are found at <a href="../../D_Settings/Building Filters/Filters Introduction.htm">Building Filters</a>. </p>
            <p>Follow these instructions to create filter(s) to specify the required Users.</p>
            <li>Select <strong>Save Competency Requirement</strong>. </li>
        </ol>

        </p>
        <p><b>Important Note:</b>
        </p>
        <p>The Competency Requirement that you just created has not actually been applied to the Users you specified until you  <a href="Run Requirements.htm#RunReq"><span class="Hyperlink">Run Requirements</span></a> and link all active Competency Requirements to their Users.</p>
