        <h1><a name="top"></a>Manage Compliance with Competency Requirements </h1>
        <p>You can view User compliance with active Competency Requirements. The information is displayed as charts, lists and numbers and can be subdivided as required into data about particular Users, Organisation Units, Organisations, Groups and Competencies, as explained below.</p>
        <p>To see this information select <b>Manage Learning &gt; Manage Competencies</b> and select <b>Manage Compliance with Competency Requirements</b> from the <b>Actions</b> dropdown.</p>
        <p>
            <img class="shareWithMenu" src="../../Resources/Images/Competencies/Manage Compliance with Competency.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>Compliance is divided into one of four categories, with Risk levels applied when nearing the expiry of a Competency, see <a href="#Validity">Compliance classifications </a> for details. </p>
        <p>These categories are shown by colours:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Competencies/green.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;border-style:none" /> = Compliant</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Competencies/yellow.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;border-style:none" /> = Low Risk</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Competencies/orange.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;border-style:none" /> = High Risk</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Competencies/red.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;border-style:none" /> = Non-Compliant</p>
        <p>Data is displayed about the Users who have Competency Requirements (CR) applied to them. Data is collected as <i>requirements for Competency</i>, i.e. the number of different Competencies involved and <i>User  Competency requirements</i>, i.e. the number of separate requirements of a User for Competency.</p>
        <p>To explain the screen display, we are using two examples here. In the first example, it is February the 29th and there is one User with one CR applied to her. This CR contains three Competencies. One Competency lasts forever and the other two have expiry dates. The User acquired all the Competencies   in February, just before the <b>Manage Compliance with Competency Requirements</b> screen was produced.</p>
        <p>Thus, there are three separate <i>User  Competency requirements</i> in the active CR system because the User is required to have three Competencies. As there are three Competencies in the active CR system, there are three <i>requirements for Competency</i>. Do not confuse this with the fact that there is one active Competency Requirement (CR).</p>
        <p>This screenshots below show all Users and all Competencies involved in active CRs:</p>
        <ol start="1">
            <li> The search bar allows you to narrow down this screen to specified User(s), Organisations, Organisation Units or Groups.</li>
            <li>The description indicates what is displayed: </li>
            <ul>
                <li>The totals of: Users (1), <i>requirements for Competency</i> (3) and  <i>User  Competency requirements</i> (3). </li>
                <li>The  <i>User  Competency requirements</i> are divided into the totals for: Compliant (2), Low Risk (1), High Risk (0) and Non-Compliant (0).</li>
            </ul>
            <li>A  pie chart visualises the totals of the four categories of  <i>User  Competency requirements</i>.</li>
            <li>This data is also mapped in a timeline that shows how today’s data would be affected over time, with one row per  <i>User  Competency requirement</i>. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Competencies/ManageComplianceS1.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p> Moving the cursor over the timeline creates popups showing how compliance data changes over time as the Competencies approach their expiry dates. </p>
        <p>We can see below that  in April, one <i>User  Competency requirement</i> is Compliant (green), one High Risk (orange) and one Non-Compliant (red).</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Competencies/ManageComplianceS2.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Remember that the User acquired all three Competencies in February but each one has a different validity period, as we will see below.</p>
        <ol start="5">
            <li>To study the situation in more detail select the <b>Details (by User)</b> collapsible window to open it.</li>
            <li>The pie chart shows that  the User is Compliant at the moment in two of her requirements and Low Risk for the other. Note that the timeline displays her overall status for February using the Competency that expires earliest.</li>
            <li>Selecting <b>View More</b> takes us to a screen providing details about each Competency.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Competencies/ManageComplianceS3.png" />
        </p>
        <p>In this simple example, the top half of the screen below does not give any extra information because there is only one User in the entire system.  The <b>Details</b> area is more useful and shows the date that each of the User's Competencies was acquired and its expiry date.</p>
        <ol start="8">
            <li>The <i>Orientation</i> Competency is valid forever and represents the first green User  Competency requirement line in the timeline.</li>
            <li>The <i>First Aid Procedures</i> Competency is valid for three months. As it was acquired on February 18 and it is now February 29, it is <a href="#Validity">classified</a> as Compliant because it will still be valid two months into the future, i.e. on April 29. </li>
            <p>Next month it will be classified as Low-Risk, the following month it will be High Risk, and so on.</p>
            <li>The <i>CPR Techniques</i> Competency is valid for two months. Also acquired on February 18, it is <a href="#Validity">classified</a> as Low Risk because it will only be valid until 17 April, which is more than one month from now but less than two months from now.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Competencies/ManageComplianceS4.png" />
        </p>
        <p>The bottom part of the <b>Manage Compliance with Competency Requirements</b> screen summarises the data per Competency.</p>
        <ol start="11">
            <li>Select <b>Details (by Competency)</b> to open the collapsible window. In this simple example we do not learn anything new because each Competency is only required by the same User we have just seen.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Competencies/ManageComplianceS5.png" />
        </p>
        <h3>A more complex example</h3>
        <p>In a more complex example, it is still February but there are four Users with Competency Requirements (CR) applied to them. </p>
        <p>There are three different CRs in this system, each with a unique Competency. So there are three separate Competencies involved and hence three <i>requirements for Competency</i>. As before, one Competency lasts forever and the other two have expiry dates. Users who have acquired their Competency did so in February.</p>
        <p>In this example each CR is linked to one Competency and each User has only been linked to one CR. Thus per User, there is only one <i>User  Competency requirement</i>, giving a total of four User  Competency requirements in the system. </p>
        <p>The <b>Manage Compliance with Competency Requirements</b> screen shows all Users and all Competencies involved in active CRs.</p>
        <ol start="1">
            <li>The description indicates what is included in this display: </li>
            <ul>
                <li>The totals of: Users (4), <i>requirements for Competency</i> (3) and <i>User  Competency requirements</i> (4). </li>
                <li>The <i>User  Competency requirements</i> are divided into the totals for: Compliant (2), Low Risk (1), High Risk and Non-Compliant(1).</li>
            </ul>
            <li>A  pie chart visualises the totals of the four categories of <i>User  Competency requirements</i>.</li>
            <li>This data is also mapped in a timeline that shows how today’s data would be affected over time, with one row per <i>User  Competency requirement</i>. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Competencies/ManageCompliance1.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>Remember that in this example all Users acquired their Competency in February but each of the three Competencies has a different expiry period.</p>
        <ol start="4">
            <li>The <b>Details (by User)</b> collapsible window shows the User data. </li>
            <li><i>Administrator Smith</i> is Compliant with all her requirements (one, in this example). Her Competency is valid for three months. It is now February and she will be compliant for at least 2 months. She will become Low Risk next month in March, High Risk the following month (April) and Non-Compliant after that. </li>
            <li>In contrast, <i>Betty Broen</i> is Non-Compliant now and in the future. Her Competency has not been acquired.</li>
            <li><i>Katie Dale</i> is Compliant now and this will not change over time. Her Competency is valid forever.</li>
            <li><i>Nash Connors</i> is Low-Risk now, will become High Risk next month and Non-Compliant after that.</li>
            <li>Clicking <b>View More</b> displays more information about the User and the Competencies involved.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Competencies/ComplianceUsers1.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>In the case of <i>Nash Connors</i>, <b>View More</b> shows:</p>
        <ol start="10">
            <li>Only one Competency is required of him and he is considered Low Risk at the moment.</li>
            <li>This data is visualised as a pie chart and on a timeline.</li>
            <li>He acquired the <i>CPR&#160;techniques</i> Competency on Feb 18 and currently holds it. However it will expire on April 18, which is more than one month but less than two months from now and  classifies the compliance as Low-Risk. It becomes High Risk in March, and so on.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Competencies/ComplianceViewMore.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <ol start="13">
            <li>Select the <b>Details (by Competency)</b> collapsible window to open it and see the data about the Competencies involved.</li>
            <li>The identifier and name of each Competency is listed.</li>
            <li>The numbers of requirements of a User for each Competency in each of the four states is visualised as a pie chart. For example, every requirement to hold the <i>Orientation</i> Competency is compliant. However only half of those required to have the <i>First Aid Procedures</i> comply.</li>

        </p>
        <p><b>Notes</b>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Remember that, if one User has one CR applied to them and it contains  multiple Competencies, the system shows multiple requirements of one User for Competency, i.e. <i>User Competency requirements</i>.</li>
            <li>This screen reports on Competency Requirements. If you require reports about Competencies  only, go to <b><a href="../Customisable Reports/Customisable reports introduction.htm" style="font-weight: normal;">Manage Learning &gt; Customisable Reports</a></b> and create a custom report on the <i>Competency User Status</i> entity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><a name="Validity"></a>Compliance classifications </h3>
        <p>A User is compliant in relation to a particular Competency – at a particular point in time – if they have a completed enrolment in the learning associated with the Competency and either:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> the Competency is valid forever, or</li>
            <li> the point in time for which we are calculating compliance is between the completion date and the expiry date (the completion date plus the Competency’s validity period).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The User is classified as <b>Compliant</b> when  compliant in relation to the Competency and this will be true for  2 months or more into the future.</p>
        <p>The risk classifications are defined as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Low Risk</b>: User is compliant in relation to the Competency and this will be true for 1 month or more but less than 2 months into the future.</li>
            <li><b>High Risk</b>: User is compliant in relation to the Competency and this will be true for less than 1 month into the future.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The User is <b>Non Compliant</b> when:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> they do not have the Competency at all, or</li>
            <li>they had it but the Competency has expired.</li>
        </ul>
