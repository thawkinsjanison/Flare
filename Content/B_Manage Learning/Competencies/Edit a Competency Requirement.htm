        <p>Notes</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can change the name and/or identifier of the Competency Requirement and all of its existing relationships (such as a link to a Catalogue Item) will be retained.</li>
            <li>The edited Competency Requirement is not actually applied to the relevant Users until you <b>Run Requirements</b> for that Competency Requirement. See <a href="Run Requirements.htm#RunReq" class="Hyperlink">Run Requirements</a></li>
            <li>If you have edited the Competency Requirement so that Users who were previously selected by filter(s) are no longer selected, then after you <b>Run Requirements</b> those Users will no longer have the Competency Requirement attached to them. The same applies if you remove Competencies from the Competency Requirement.</li>
