        <h1 class="Heading1">Link Competency to learning </h1>
        <p>You can link Competencies to Catalogue Items, Courses and Assignments. The first of these is the most common. </p>
        <p>A User acquires one or more Competencies or Competency sets when they complete the learning that has been linked to them.</p>
        <h2>Link Competency to a Catalogue Item </h2>
        <p>To link Competency to a Catalogue Item navigate to <strong>Manage Learning &gt; Manage Catalogue</strong>,       locate the required Catalogue Item and select it. 
        </p>
        <p>Select <strong>Edit Catalogue Item</strong> from the <strong>Actions</strong> dropdown.</p>
        <p>
            <img class="shareWithMenu" src="../../Resources/Images/Competencies/CompetenciesLink.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>Select the <strong>Competencies</strong> collapsible window to open it.</p>
        <p>
            <img class="shareWithMenu" src="../../Resources/Images/Competencies/Competencies.png" />
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select a Competency or Competency Set from the dropdown then select the <strong>+</strong> icon at the right.</li>
            <p>Note that there is no indication whether a list item is a Competency or Competency Set.</p>
            <li>Once you have linked the item, you will see it listed under <b>Competencies for this Catalogue Item</b>.</li>
            <li>You can unlink it by selecting the red <strong>minus</strong> icon. You can move its position in the list by dragging the <strong>crosshair</strong> icon.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Select<strong> Save Catalogue Item</strong> when you have finished.
        </p>
        <p>Note:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you link a Competency to a Catalogue Item after a User has completed their enrolment in the Catalogue Item, they will not receive the Competency. If this is required, then the enrolment can be edited to add the Competency.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Link Competency to a Course </h2>
        <p> To link Competency to a Course follow the steps to <a href="../../C_Design/courses2/Edit or Delete a Course.htm">edit the Course</a> and select <b>Competencies</b> to open the collapsible window.</p>
        <p>Follow the steps 1-3 for linking Competency to a Catalogue Item and save the Course.</p>
        <h2>Link Competency to an Assignment</h2>
        <p> To link Competency to an Assignment edit the Assignment and select <b>Competencies</b> to open the collapsible window.</p>
        <p>Follow steps 1-3 for linking Competency to a Catalogue Item.</p>
        <p>There is an additional option for Assignments where you must specify whether to automatically award Competencies when the learner passes the Assignment or whether the facilitator manually awards the Competencies if they were demonstrated in the Assignment.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Competencies/CompetencyAssignment.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Save the Assignment.</p>
        <h3>Renewing a Competency</h3>
        <p>If you link  learning to a Competency that is not valid forever, the Competency needs to be renewed periodically. Thus, the Catalogue Item (or Catalogue Item that the Learning Asset is linked to) must allow re-enrolments so that Users can re-enrol in the Catalogue Item and re-acquire the Competency.</p>
