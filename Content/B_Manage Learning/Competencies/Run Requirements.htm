        <p>A Competency Requirement is not actually linked to the Users it specifies until you <em style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">Run Requirements</em>.</p>
        <p>To do this select <strong>Manage Learning &gt; Manage Competencies</strong> and then select <strong>Manage Competency Requirements</strong> from the <strong>Actions</strong> dropdown.</p>
        <p>
            <img class="shareWithMenu" src="../../Resources/Images/Competencies/Add a Competency Requirement.png" />
        </p>
        <p> This takes you to the <b>Manage Competency Requirements</b> screen.</p>
        <p>Select <strong>Run Requirements</strong>. This will process all active Competency Requirements.</p>
        <p>
            <img class="shareWithMenu" src="../../Resources/Images/Competencies/Run Requirements_1.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>After you have Run Requirements, you should notice that the number next to <em>Affects Users</em> has changed for new Competency Requirements, because Users have just been linked to the Requirement. </p>

        </p>
        <p><b>Important Note:</b>
        </p>
        <p>If you have edited a Competency Requirement so that Users who were previously selected by filter(s) are no longer selected, then after you <b>Run Requirements</b> those Users will no longer have the Competency Requirement attached to them. The same applies if you remove Competencies from the Competency Requirement. In other words, Run Requirements always starts from scratch.</p>
