        <p>Extra Note about <b>Validity</b>:</p>
        <p>If a Competency is defined as being valid for a certain period of time, it expires after this period is over. This period of time is measured from the date the User completes the linked learning asset and acquires the Competency.</p>
        <p>Thus, a User holding a Competency will lose the Competency after the validity period is over.</p>
