        <p>Competency can be defined as the ability of an individual to do his or her job properly. Every organisation has its own collections of defined competencies that are important for the performance of the different kinds of work that the organisation does. On a national or international level, a set of recognised competencies is called a qualification.</p>
        <p>Competencies can be either</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Nationally recognised competencies, as per TGA at <a href="http://training.gov.au/Home/Tga"><a href="http://training.gov.au/Home/Tga" target="_blank"><span class="Hyperlink">http://training.gov.au/Home/Tga</span></a></a></li>
            <li>In house competencies which relate only to an organisation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the CLS, <b>Competencies</b> are linked to Catalogue Items containing learning assets such as courses or training events. Competencies can also be linked directly to Courses and Assignments. A User acquires Competencies through enrolment in and completion of these learning assets. </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Competencies can be defined as permanent or as only lasting for defined periods of time. They can also be collected into functional units called <b>Competency Sets</b>. </p>
        <p><b>Competency Requirements</b> are collections of Competencies that are set up so that Users are required to acquire these competencies. Managers can run various reports to determine compliance with specified Competency Requirements amongst staff.</p>
        <p>Note that in a MOOC environment, Endorsements work alongside Competencies and give learners the opportunity to recognise the skills of their peers.</p>
