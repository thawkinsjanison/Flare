        <h2 class="Heading2">Activating the plug-ins</h2>
        <p>Your Janison CLS will not support Learning Plans if you don’t have the <i>Plans</i> plug-in activated.</p>
        <p>If you are using the <i>Log external learning</i> feature, you will need to have the <i>Other Learning</i> plug-in activated.</p>
        <p>If you don’t have these activated, you will need to contact the Client Services Team at Janison. It will only take a moment to activate it.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Switch on Discussion Settings Post types</h2>
        <p>To allow learners to visually classify their journal comments you need to make sure that the Post Types are switched on. Go to <b>Settings</b> &gt; <b>Discussion Settings</b> to select and save these. </p>

        <h2 class="Heading2">Doing the background work</h2>
        <p>Before your users can have a learning plan, you need to do some set up work. Firstly, ask yourself some questions.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Do I want my users to link their learning plans to a particular set of professional standards or similar?</p>
        <p>If so, you will need to set up a Tag for each standard and group them into one or more Tag Types. You connect one or more Tag Types to a plan. Learners can link one or more of the Tags in these Tag Types to an individual entry. This also filters the list of possible Catalogue Items that they can link to that entry.</p>
        <p><b>Do I want to manage their learning in any way?</b> Some organisations want learning grouped into learning areas or need to record which competency certain pieces of learning relate to. This is particularly relevant if your learners need to meet CPD requirements. If so, you need to set up CPD points and link them to Tags and Catalogue Items beforehand so that learners can log the points acquired. </p>
        <p><b>Do I want my users to be able to record learning they have done outside the CLS against their learning plans?</b>
        </p>
        <p>If so, you will need to set up a learning asset of type <em>Other Learning</em> and link it to a Catalogue Item. In addition to the basic steps you will need to do five things:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
            <li>Check the <i>Allow learner to link to learning plan entry box</i> <![CDATA[ ]]></li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Learning Plans1/Setting up for a Learning_1.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>Note that you can optionally set the Other Learning asset to require points:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Learning Plans1/Setting up for a Learning_2.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>If this is set then the learner must enter points against CPD Tags when logging external learning.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="2">
            <li>Put the asset into a Catalogue Item alone, i.e. as the only Learning Asset in that Catalogue Item.</li>
            <li>Give the Catalogue Item a name that will be meaningful to your learners. This is particularly important if you are going to use more than one Catalogue Item so that external learning can be recorded against different groups. Your learners will see the Catalogue Items in a drop down menu when they are editing their learning plans. The name in the screenshot below would not particularly enlighten learners!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Learning Plans1/Setting up for a Learning_3.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="4">
            <li>If your learners need to record a course accreditation number when they record their learning, check the <strong>Allows accreditation number</strong> box </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Learning Plans1/Setting up for a Learning_4.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>Note that if you are using this, it’s probably because some of the learning your learners will do outside the JanisonCLS will be accredited and some won’t be. Do not put a Course Accreditation Number on the Catalogue Item as well. If you do and the learner doesn’t enter a Course Accreditation Number when they record their learning, it will default to the one you put on the Catalogue Item.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="5">
            <li>Make the Catalogue Item private (i.e. don’t publish it in the catalogue), see Make a Catalogue Item private or public.</li>
        </ol>
