        <h1 class="Heading1">Create and Edit a Learning Plan</h1>
        <p>Note that you can’t use the <a href="../../B_Manage Learning/Add Learning/Adding Learning introduction.htm">Add Learning</a> wizard to create Learning Plans because they are too complex to work in the wizard. Instead go to <b>Manage Learning</b><strong> &gt; Manage Learning Assets</strong> and then add a new Learning Asset.</p>
        <p>Select <strong>New Plan </strong>and fill in the basic information:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
            <li>Enter a <b>Name</b>.</li>
            <li>Enter an <b>Identifier</b>.</li>
            <li>Enter a <b>Description</b>.</li>
            <li>Click <b>Save Plan</b>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Learning Plans1/Create and Edit a Learning.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>Once you have created the plan, you see its inspection screen. You can go back and alter its basic information by clicking <b>Edit Plan</b> from this inspection screen. </p>
        <p>In the inspection screen you specify the plan’s settings in a number of separate categories. Click the chevron next to the category to view what has been specified; click the pencil to edit it and then click <b>Save</b>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Learning Plans1/Create and Edit a Learning_1.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Introduction text</h2>
        <p>If you have a way you’d like learners to use learning plans, specific instructions or other information you’d like to convey to learners when they are creating their plans, include it here. The editor allows for rich text so you can link a video presentation or other media if you want to. Whatever you enter here will be presented to every learner at the top of their main learning plan screen.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="_Plan_Settings"></a>Plan Settings</h2>
        <p>If you want your learners to link Catalogue Items to the entries in their learning plans check this option. Your learners can then link particular Catalogue Item(s) to an entry and will be presented with a link taking them to that particular learning item. Once the learning is complete your learners will get an acknowledgement within the entry tile when they have completed it:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Learning Plans1/Create and Edit a Learning_2.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>Note that your learners are not forced to complete the learning before completing the Learning Plan entry.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Learning Plans1/Create and Edit a Learning_3.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>If you do not select the option to link to Catalogue Items then learners enter only descriptions of activities and dates in their plan entries. They can however log external learning if that option has been switched on in the External Learning category (see <a href="#_External_Learning"><span class="Hyperlink">External Learning</span></a>).</p>
        <p>Note also that when you can edit this setting when a plan is already underway and remove the option to link to Catalogue Items; references to Catalogue Item(s) are then removed from existing plans.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Completion Rules</h2>
        <p>Here you determine how your learner can complete their entire learning plan and what happens next. Note that plan <i>entries</i> can still be completed by the learner regardless of what is set for the completion of the <i>Plan</i> itself.</p>
        <p>The on-screen instructions explain what each option means.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Learning Plans1/Create and Edit a Learning_4.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>The options are:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;"><b>No Completion</b> - the plan can never be completed. The learner cannot change the plan’s status indicator from In Progress:</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Learning Plans1/Create and Edit a Learning_5.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
            <br />If desired, the administrator can of course force-complete the Catalogue Item that the plan is linked to, see the document on Inspect Catalogue Item. </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;"><b>Completion controlled by learner</b> –the learner can complete the plan by changing its status:</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Learning Plans1/Create and Edit a Learning_6.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>Note that the plan does not need to be 100% complete for this to be possible and the status of the entries is not changed by this action.</p>
        <p>Additional options related to plans that can be completed are:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;"><b>Enable Rollover</b> – this allows the learner to take incomplete learning plan entries from a current plan into a new plan. It also completes the old plan. When a learner rolls a plan over, a new enrolment in the same plan is automatically created. Entries in the learning plan which are Incomplete at the time of rollover are automatically added to the new learning plan, but Comments from the old plan are not.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;"><b>Can edit after completion</b> – allows a learner to edit a plan, even if they’ve completed it. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note that if learners roll their plan over, they are creating a new enrolment in the same Learning Plan. They can only have one current enrolment in a Learning Plan so once the new one is created and ready to edit, they will no longer be allowed to edit their old plan, even if the edit option is checked. They are however able to view it. Note also that this ability to re-enrol in the same Catalogue Item overrides what was set at the Catalogue Item level, i.e. the following setting:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Learning Plans1/Create and Edit a Learning_7.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Start and End Date rules</h2>
        <p>Some organisations want learning plans to have specific start/end dates. Others prefer to allow learners to choose their own dates or don’t want plans to have end dates at all.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
            <li>If you do not check <i>Allow Start/End Date</i> then the plan is labelled a <i>continuous</i> plan and there will be no start/end dates on the plan. Note that there will however be completion dates for the individual plan entries.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>When you check Allow Start/End date a number of options appear in the settings. </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;;" start="2">
            <li>If you want the learner to control their own dates, check <i>Allow Start/End Date</i> and <i>Allow Learner/Manager</i> to <i>control Dates</i> but don’t set any rules for the Start date or the End date. Once dates are entered by the learner the plan becomes a <i>dated</i> plan.</li>
            <li>If you want a dated plan but don’t want the learner to control their own dates, you must select options for the Start and End date Rules.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Learning Plans1/Create and Edit a Learning_8.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>Start date rule options are:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>The plan starts on the day the learner is enrolled in it.</li>
            <li>The plan starts on a particular day of the current year (even if that day is in the past).</li>
            <li>The plan starts on a particular date when it next occurs. This means that, for example, if today is 15<sup>th</sup> March 2015 and you select 1 May, the plan will start on 1 May 2015. However, if you choose 1 March, the plan won’t start until 1 March 2016.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There is only one choice for the End date rule: the number of days or months after the plan starts should it end.</p>
        <p>Note that these rules only apply at the time learners are enrolled in the plan. Once they are enrolled, any changes you make here won’t affect their plans.</p>
        <p>Note also that these start and end dates do not affect whether the learner can complete a dated plan.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Plan Entry Tag Types</h2>
        <p>This is where you use the Tags that you created for the professional standards you want your learners to link to their plans, see <a href="Setting up for a Learning.htm#_Setting_up_for"><span class="Hyperlink">Setting up for a Learning Plan</span></a>.</p>
        <p>Click and select the Tag Types that you created from the list that will appear in the box below. Click the cross icon to delete a Tag Type that you have selected.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Learning Plans1/Create and Edit a Learning_9.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>The Tags in the Tag Type(s) that you choose will appear to the learners as options when they create or edit learning plan entries.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Learning Plans1/Create and Edit a Learning_10.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>If Catalogue Items are also linked to plan entries (see <a href="#_Plan_Settings"><span class="Hyperlink">Plan Settings</span></a>) then learners will have the list of possible Catalogue Items filtered so that they only see those Catalogue Items that are linked to the Tag(s) selected.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Learning Plans1/Create and Edit a Learning_11.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>The Tag(s) selected will also appear on their tile for that entry, see <a href="Using a learning plan as a.htm#_Using_a_learning_2"><span class="Hyperlink">Using a learning plan as a learner</span></a>.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="_External_Learning"></a>External Learning</h2>
        <p>This is for learners to record learning that happens outside the CLS. You use the Other Learning assets you set up previously, see <a href="Setting up for a Learning.htm#_Setting_up_for"><span class="Hyperlink">Setting up for a Learning Plan</span></a>. Note that you don’t have to have Can Link Catalogue Items set (Plan Settings) for this to function.</p>
        <p>When you click in the <b>Link catalogue item</b> box, a list of Catalogue Items that contain only one “Other Learning” asset will appear. Choose the ones that you would like the users to use when recording their external learning.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Learning Plans1/Create and Edit a Learning_12.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>If you can’t see your Other Learning item here, check the following:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
            <li>Is it actually in a Catalogue Item, not just a Learning Asset?</li>
            <li>Did you check <i>Allow learner to link to learning plan entry</i> in the Other Learning set-up? If you didn’t, it won’t be visible to you.</li>
            <li>Is there another Learning Asset in the same Catalogue Item as the Other Learning asset? If so, it won’t be visible to you here. The Other Learning asset needs to be the only asset in the Catalogue Item for it to be used this way.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>When learners are logging External Learning the Catalogue Items you chose appear as: </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Learning Plans1/Setting up for a Learning_3.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" /> </p>
        <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="_Default_learning_plan_1"></a>Default learning plan entries</h2>
        <p>You as the plan&#39;s designer can add Learning Plan Entries to a plan before you allow learners to enrol. These can be ones that are mandatory for learners or ones that can be modified by them. Learners will see them in their plan.</p>
        <p>Click <b>Add default entry</b> to add an entry:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Learning Plans1/Create and Edit a Learning_13.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>The pop-up that appears will allow you to add an entry. The fields are the same as those that are visible to the learner when they create a new Learning Plan Entry (see <a href="Using a learning plan as a.htm#_Add_/_Edit"><span class="Hyperlink">Add/</span><span class="Hyperlink">Edit Learning Plan Entries</span></a>) except for Default behaviour.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Learning Plans1/Create and Edit a Learning_14.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>Select an option for <b>Default Behaviour</b>:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;"><b>Pre-populated</b> means that the entry will appear in the plan of everyone who enrols but it won’t be made mandatory. This means that the learner will be able to edit every field, except Learning Objective and will be able to delete the entry from their plan.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;"><b>Mandatory</b> means that the entry will appear in the plan of everyone who enrols and it will be mandatory. This means the learner will only be able to alter the planned and actual completion dates and will not be able to delete the entry from their plan. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Enter data in the rest of the fields as desired and Click Save</p>
        <p>Mandatory items will appear with a small M on the entry tile – visible both to the administrator and to the learner:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Learning Plans1/Create and Edit a Learning_15.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>When you click <b>Save</b> you will see a confirmation screen and you will be offered the option to add this entry to existing enrolments. This means that people who are already enrolled in this plan – but haven’t yet completed it – will have this entry added to their plan.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Learning Plans1/Create and Edit a Learning_16.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>If you choose to add this to existing plans, you will see a spinner appear over the tile that represents the entry and then a message telling you if the operation was successful or not. If it was not successful, you will have the option to retry.</p>
        <p>If you try a couple of time and it still fails, contact your system administrator.</p>
        <p>Note that the M is a string resource that you can alter. To change it, change the search parameters in string resources to search within the Janison.Plans plug in, look for Janison.Plans/UIElements.MandatoryItemLetter and then change the value “M”. See document on String Resources for more information.</p>

        </p>
        <h3 class="Heading3">Editing and deleting Default Learning Plan Entries</h3>
        <p>If you need to edit a default learning plan entry that you have already created, click the pencil on its tile and make changes. When you save your changes, you will be offered the opportunity to push that change out to existing enrolments. However, if learners have already made changes to their version of the entry, your changes will not be applied. </p>
        <p>You can also delete default entries from learning plans, and from existing enrolments in learning plans. To delete, click on the pencil icon on the top right of the tile to edit it and then click Delete.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Learning Plans1/Create and Edit a Learning_18.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>You can delete any entry regardless of whether it is pre-populated or mandatory.</p>
        <p>Once you have confirmed the deletion, you will be presented with an option to delete the entry from existing plans.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Learning Plans1/Create and Edit a Learning_19.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>There are some rules around this</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 18pt;" start="1">
            <li>You cannot delete completed entries. If the learner has applied a completed date to the entry, it will not delete.</li>
            <li>If the entry is mandatory, you have absolute control and you can delete the entry, regardless of whether the learner has recorded a planned date, subject to rule 1.</li>
            <li>If the entry is optional (status = pre-populated) you can delete it (subject to rule 1) unless</li>
        </ol>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
            <li>The learner has changed the “Planned activities” text; or</li>
            <li>The learner has added a planned completion date.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Sorting learning plan entries </h2>
        <p>Learning plan entries are sorted automatically using these three rules</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
            <li>Items with a completed date are put to the end of the list; then</li>
            <li>Items with a planned completed date are put in order by that date ascending; then</li>
            <li>Items are sorted by Learning Objective in alphabetical order.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you would like to put entries in a certain order for a learner to follow, give them objective names in alphabetical order. The easiest way to do this is to put a number (1, 2 etc.) as the first part of the objective text.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Setting up the Catalogue Item for the plan</h2>
        <p>Use <strong>Manage Catalogue &gt; </strong> <b>Add Catalogue Item</b> to create a new a Catalogue Item with its linked Learning Asset being the plan that you have created.</p>
        <p>You can make the Catalogue Item public or private. </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">If you want your learners to enrol themselves, make it public. It will then appear in the catalogue under <i>Browse Learning</i>.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">If you want to control enrolments using <a href="../../B_Manage Learning/Assign Learning/Assigning Learning introduction.htm">Assign Learning</a> or any of the automatic enrolment options, make the item private.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can assign any Catalogue Item settings you like however it’s probably worth remembering:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">If you don’t want users to have to pay to have a plan, make sure the price is zero and the self-enrolment method is set to <i>Self-enrol (free)</i>.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Setting the self-enrol to <i>Manager approved</i> doesn’t mean that the manager will be asked to check the content of the learning plan, just asked to approve the learner starting a plan. </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Learning Plans don’t count as learning for the purposes of transcripts.</li>
        </ul>
