        <h1 class="Heading1"><a name="_Using_a_learning_2"></a>Using a learning plan as a learner</h1>
        <p>For learners, the Learning Plans offer a versatile and intuitive way to plan and record their learning.</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>They can start from a blank learning plan or use a template that has been provided (from a rollover or a default entry).</li>
            <li>They can have more than one learning plan running concurrently.</li>
            <li>They can choose and link courses from the CLS to help meet learning goals or undertake learning outside the CLS and record it against their plan manually.</li>
            <li>Remember, they can enrol in more than one Learning Plan from the catalogue, they just can’t enrol in the same plan a second time until they have completed the first enrolment or rolled it over.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Starting a new plan</h2>
        <p>Accessing a Learning Plans operates like the access to any other Catalogue Item in the CLS.</p>
        <p>When they open a new Learning Plan they see:</p>
        <ol start="1">
            <li>The name of the plan.</li>
            <li>An indication of how much has been completed.</li>
            <li>Plan dates if applicable, otherwise the text <em>continuous plan</em>.</li>
            <li>The status widget for the plan.</li>
            <li>The introduction written by the plan’s creator.</li>
            <li>Space to enter the goals of the plan.</li>
            <li>Dates, if applicable.</li>
            <li>A tile for Learning Plan Entry creation.</li>
            <li>A comments window that opens when the chevron is clicked.</li>
            <li>Previous plans can be examined by clicking this chevron.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The screen may also have one or more Default Entries depending on how the plan was set up.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Populating the plan</h2>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li><b>Introduction</b>: If there is introductory text, it has been provided by the organisation to help them understand how management would like them to use learning plans.</li>
            <li><b>Goals</b>: This is a free text field for them to outline, at a high level, what their goals and direction are for this plan. They click in it to edit it. When they’re happy with the changes, they click the green tick on the right or just click on another control and the text will save.</li>
            <li><b>Dates</b>: They may not see these if admin has disabled them. These are the start and end dates of the plan. Depending on the permissions admin has allowed, they may have to use these dates or they may be able to edit them. If they try to change them and are not allowed to, they won’t be able to save the changes.</li>
            <li><b>Learning Plan Entries</b>: These are the specific learning objectives that they have for this plan. </li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: circle;">They can add learning plan entries by clicking the plus icon, see below for details.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: circle;">If they would like to <b>edit</b> existing entries, use the pencil icon on the top right of the tile.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: circle;">If they would like to <b>delete</b> an entry, click the pencil in the top right to edit then select <strong>Delete</strong> in the bottom left. If <em>Delete</em> is missing, it has been disabled by the administrator.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;"><i>Log External Learning</i> on the bottom right of an entry tile allows them to record learning they’ve done outside the JanisonCLS. See below for details. If this option is missing, the administrator has disabled it.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;"><b>Comment</b>: This is a journal that is specific to this plan. Only they can see what they write in this journal. They can use it for any purpose desired, including:</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: circle;">Recording comments, reflections, questions and answers on any learning they’ve undertaken.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: circle;">Uploading documents such as a CV, a referee’s report or something else of relevance to them.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li><b>Status</b>: This allows them to complete the plan or roll your plan over. If this is missing, admin has disabled it.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note that if they complete their plan, they may not be able to edit it again so they should make sure they really want to complete a plan. If they roll a plan over, they will get a new plan using the same learning plan template. Any learning plan entries that are incomplete will be copied over into the new learning plan.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3"><a name="_Add_/_Edit"></a>Add / Edit Learning Plan Entries</h3>
        <p>They add a learning plan entry by clicking on this tile</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Learning Plans1/Using a learning plan as a_1.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>They edit a learning plan entry by clicking on the pencil icon on the top / right of an existing entry</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Learning Plans1/Using a learning plan as a_2.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>This pop-up appears when they add or edit a Learning Plan Entry.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Learning Plans1/Using a learning plan as a_3.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p><b>Learning Objective</b>: they must fill in this field. It is a description that is meaningful to them about what their objective is. It might be something like “Improve my customer service skills” or “Achieve level 2 professional accreditation”. It can be whatever they like. The important thing is not to have two the same – it will cause grief later.</p>
        <p><b>Planned Activities</b>: This is a free text field for them to outline, in a way that makes sense to them, what they will do to achieve the objective they’ve set. They are not linking specific courses here; that part comes later.</p>
        <p><b>Tags</b>: This control may not be visible (the administrator can choose to disable it) but, if it is, they will need to choose which professional standards (or similar) this objective relates to. Choose one or more from the drop-down.</p>
        <p><b>Catalogue Items</b>: This control may not be visible (the administrator can choose to disable it). If it is visible, they can choose any item from the catalogue to link to this entry. When they do this, their completion of the item and any CPD points they gain for it will be recorded in their learning plan. Note that choosing them here does not automatically enrol them in the relevant course.</p>
        <p><b>Planned Completion</b>: When do they think they will achieve this objective by?</p>
        <p><b>Completed Date</b>: When did they actually achieve the objective? If they put a date into this field, the learning plan entry status will go to <em>Completed</em>.</p>
        <p>Once they have completed this form and saved changes, the details will appear on a Learning Plan Entries tile in the main screen. From there, they can link <b>External Learning</b> to this entry.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Making changes to their plan</h2>
        <p>Unless items have been locked as mandatory by the administrator, they can make changes to any part of the plan at any time. They can add, edit or delete learning plan entries, add or remove Catalogue Items, change their goals etc.</p>
        <p>Learning plan entries are shown as tiles at the bottom of the screen:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Learning Plans1/Using a learning plan as a_4.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>To view the details of one of their learning plan entries, they click the relevant tile. It will expand and, possibly, move to show the details of that entry. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Learning Plans1/Using a learning plan as a_5.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>The Tags, linked Catalogue Items and recorded external learning are all clickable:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;"><strong>Tags</strong> will open a new tab and will show all the catalogue items that are associated with that tag.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;"><strong>Catalogue items</strong> will open a new tab to allow them to enrol in or complete the Catalogue Item.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;"><strong>External learning </strong>will open a summary screen of that external learning.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note that they must click the text on the grey button, not the button itself.</p>
        <p>To shrink the tile, they click it again.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Recording learning on your plan</h2>
        <p>As they complete their planned learning, they want to get credit for it on their plan. They can do a number of things:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">If the learning is in the CLS catalogue and they have linked the Catalogue Item to the plan (see above) then they will automatically get credit in their learning plan:</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Learning Plans1/Create and Edit a Learning_2.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>If there were CPD points attached to the Catalogue Item they are displayed, along with other details, when they click the text on this grey button.</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">If the learning is external to the JanisonCLS, they can record it against a learning plan entry using the Log <i>External Learning</i> option on the tile.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If there are CPD points entered for the external learning item they are displayed, along with other details, when they click the text on its grey button.</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: circle;">If this option is missing, it has been disabled by the administrator.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: circle;">See below for how to use this feature.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">They can note that an entire learning objective has been completed by editing the relevant learning plan entry and adding a completion date. </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">They can make comments on their learning or upload documents to the plan through the Comments feature. See below for how to use this feature. </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Once everything is completed, they can select <b>Complete</b> from the Status widget on the main screen and this will close out the plan.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Recording external learning</h2>
        <p>When they go to a course or undertake other study or relevant professional development (such as attending a conference), they can record that in the learning plan.</p>
        <p>Before they can record it, they need to have a learning plan entry to record it against. If they don’t have one, they must create one (see above for how to do this).</p>
        <p>They record their external learning by:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Finding the relevant learning plan entry tile</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Clicking the <b>log external learning</b> control on the bottom right of the tile.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: circle;">Note – if this feature isn’t there, it has been disabled by the administrator.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">If there is more than one option in the drop-down, they choose the one most appropriate to the learning they have completed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Learning Plans1/Setting up for a Learning_3.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>Once they select an option, the External Learning pop-up will appear.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
            <li><b>Plan Entry</b>: This is the Learning Plan Entry to which they would like to link this external learning record. It defaults to the one they selected but they can change it.</li>
            <li>The <b>Instruction</b> field comes from what has been set up for this Learning Asset.</li>
            <li><b>Learner submission notes</b>: This is a free text field for them to make some notes about what they learned, what topics they covered etc.</li>
            <li>Click <b>Save</b> to save the file.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Learning Plans1/Using a learning plan as a_6.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>Once they save the record, it will appear on the relevant learning plan entry tile. To see it, they click the tile to expand it:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Learning Plans1/Using a learning plan as a_7.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>They click the text on the grey button to open the record they have just created. Note that they can add more than one piece of External Learning but they can’t delete them.</p>
        <p>Note also that the screenshot above was the basic version of the external learning screen. Their administrator can customise the External Learning function and may have added extra fields that they need to fill in. The extra pieces of information they enter here will also be shown when they click the external learning‘s grey button in the Learning Plan tile.</p>
        <p>These extra fields include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Certificate Number</b>: If they earned a certificate, licence or other accreditation from completing this learning, they enter that number here.</li>
            <li><b>Course Accreditation Number</b>: If the course they attended is accredited in some way, they enter the course accreditation number here.</li>
            <li><b>Upload file</b>: If they need to include documentary evidence of this learning, they upload a file using this button.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>They click <b>Select file</b> to upload the file.</p>
        <p>They click the cross icon to delete the file.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Completed Date</b>: the date they actually did the training, attended the event etc. </li>
            <li>Valid To / Expiry Date: the date it expires.</li>
            <li><b>Provider</b> – the provider of this training.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the administrator has implemented <b>Points</b> for the external learning they will see some extra fields in this screen: the categories of points that are involved with CPD Plans. </p>
        <p>They enter the number of points they earned from this learning into the relevant category or categories.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Learning Plans1/Using a learning plan as a_8.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Using the Comments feature</h2>
        <p>Comments are a private journal that only they can see. They are made up of a series of messages that can have files attached and extra comments added to them.</p>
        <p>To add a new message to the journal they:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
            <li>Click the chevron next to <b>Comments</b>.</li>
            <li>Click in the <b>New Message</b> box.</li>

            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Learning Plans1/Using a learning plan as a_9.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>A message window pops up. They click one of the icons to visually classify the message:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
            <li>General</li>
            <li>Question</li>
            <li>Support</li>

        </p>
        <p>Each message has a subject, a message body and the option to attach files. They</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="6">
            <li>Enter the message subject.</li>
            <li>Enter the message body.</li>
            <li>Click <b>Select files</b> to attach a file. They can do this more than once.</li>
            <li>Click the cross icon to disconnect the attached file.</li>
            <li>Click <b>Post</b> to add the message or cancel it.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Once the message is added to the journal they can see:</p>

            <li>Their user name and picture.</li>
            <li>The message subject and body.</li>
            <li>The visual icon they chose for the message.</li>
            <li>File(s) they attached to the message. When they move their mouse over the file, icons pop up to allow them to download it (left) or view it in full screen (right).</li>

        </p>
        <p>Note that if they had added more than one file they will see a slideshow where the arrow icons at left and right allow them to move through the file, with the row of dots indicating where they are in the sequence.</p>
