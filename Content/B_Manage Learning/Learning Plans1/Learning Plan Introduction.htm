        <h1 class="Heading1">Learning Plan Introduction </h1>
        <p>A Learning Plan is a kind of enhanced learning journal for an individual. Learning Plans are often established for a particular period of time and can be subject to administrator involvement. </p>
        <p>The plan starts with an analysis of the knowledge and skills the learner needs in order to achieve career and personal goals. The most important components of the plan are a series of <b>entries</b> describing specific learning objectives and logging their achievement. These entries can optionally be linked to learning inside or outside the CLS. The plan also contains space for a number of personal comments and linked professional documents.</p>
        <p>Thus, a Learning Plan is personal to the learner and contains:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">an introduction by the plan’s creator;</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">a statement about the learner’s broad goals and direction;</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">a number of Learning Plan Entries: sets of specific learning objectives and activities; and</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">a journal made of a number of different kinds of comments.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Learning Plans1/Learning Plan Introduction.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;border-left-style: none;border-left-width: 1px;border-left-color: #a9a9a9;border-right-style: none;border-right-width: 1px;border-right-color: #a9a9a9;border-top-style: none;border-top-width: 1px;border-top-color: #a9a9a9;border-bottom-style: none;border-bottom-width: 1px;border-bottom-color: #a9a9a9;" />
        </p>
        <p>In Learning Plan Entries the learner details a number of specific objectives that they would like to accomplish. Each entry has a number of parts:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">a description of the learning objective.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">the action the learner will take to meet that objective.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">a date by which the learner would like to meet that objective.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">(possibly) the date on which the learner says that s/he has met that objective.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">(possibly) links to Catalogue Item(s) the learner will complete or has completed to help meet this objective.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">(possibly) links to external learning conducted outside the CLS.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">an indicator of the completeness of the entry.</li>
        </ul>
              <p>Learning Plan Entries can be added or removed by the learner as desired, unless they have been made mandatory, <a href="Create and Edit a Learning.htm#_Default_learning_plan_1"><span class="Hyperlink">see </span><span class="Hyperlink">Default Learning Plan E</span><span class="Hyperlink">ntries</span></a>. The creator of a Learning Plan can add entries and Tag Types to the plan in order to direct and guide learning. S/he can also add new entries to a plan within its duration in order to respond, for example, to a change in professional expectations.</p>
        <p>When a learner completes a Catalogue Item this information can be linked back to the plan. If the learner undertakes learning or professional development outside the JanisonCLS, they can get credit for that too using the <em>Log external learning</em> feature.</p>
        <p>The comments journal serves three functions:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
            <li>a way for learners to record different kinds of comments, e.g. questions and answers, as part of their learning process.</li>
            <li>a place for learners to reflect on the learning they have undertaken and how effective it has been.</li>
            <li>a place for the learner to upload documents that are valuable artefacts for future job applications, professional development audits etc. These might include a CV, letters of reference, certificates and qualifications.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Note that:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Learners complete a Learning Plan <b>Entry</b> when they enter its completion date. They can do this whenever they choose and regardless of how far they have progressed through any linked Catalogue Item(s).</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">At this stage dated Learning <b>Plans</b> (as opposed to continuous plans) can be set to a completed status by learners whenever they choose. This can occur regardless of the dates set for the plan’s duration and of whether the Entries and/or linked Catalogue Items have all been completed. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Thus, the plan is very much a tool that can be shaped by the plan&#39;s designer but whose execution is in the hands of learners. It could be used, for example, to more overtly steer learners through CPD or Competency frameworks or through a huge catalogue of potential learning. Its mandatory items can be updated on-the-fly in order to respond to changes in the learner’s professional environment.</p>
        <p>In terms of the CLS, Learning Plans function in almost all respects like any other Learning Asset in the CLS. They can:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">be added to Catalogue Items.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">be enrolled in.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">be completed.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">be subject to enrolment rules and group enrolments.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Learners can have more than one plan at once, provided the Learning Asset is added to more than one Catalogue Item – you cannot have more than one enrolment in the same Catalogue Item at once.</p>
        <p>Note that administrators can only delete a learner’s enrolment in a Learning Plan if all of the Comments have been deleted. </p>
