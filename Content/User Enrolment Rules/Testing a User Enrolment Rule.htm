        <p>The Enrolment Rule’s testing page contains three tabs.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;margin-left: 36pt;" start="1">
            <li>The To Be Enrolled tab shows the users who will be enrolled when the rule is run.</li>
            <li>The Already Enrolled tab shows the users who have already been enrolled by this rule.</li>
            <li>The All tab show both the users to be enrolled and those users already enrolled. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>If the list of user in the To Be Enrolled tab do not match the users you would like to, it is a good idea to return to the User Enrolment Rule and adjust the filter options before continuing.</p>
