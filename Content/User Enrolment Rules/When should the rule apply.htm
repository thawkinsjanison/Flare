        <h1 class="Heading1">When should the rule apply?</h1>
        <p>There are 2 ways in which User Enrolment Rules can operate when a learner registers in the system and/or when the system runs a daily check.</p>
        <p>

        <h2 class="Heading2">On Self Registration</h2>
        <p>One or more fields on the registration form can be used as the filter for the User Enrolment Rule. As the user registers, the rule is triggered. For example, if a user selects the group First Aid Officers in the registration form, when they select the Sign Up button the rule will run and enrol them in the Catalogue Item specified in the rule.</p>
        <p>Please see the document on Self-Registration form for further information on registration.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Daily Check</h2>
        <p>The daily check will be run by a system schedule which is set at the global level of the Tenant. This is usually set to run at 2 am daily.</p>
