        <p>User Enrolment Rules are used to automatically enrol specified Users into Catalogue Items either when they register on the site or when a daily check is run by the system. The rules can be useful tools for managing mandatory training as they can monitor the learning in these enrolments and automatically create new enrolments in the learning before it expires.</p>
        <p>To manage User Enrolment Rules navigate to Settings &gt; User Enrolment Rules.</p>
