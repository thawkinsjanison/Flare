        <h1 class="Heading1">Menu Settings – Introduction</h1>
        <p>The CLS is shipped with a fully functional, standard menu structure that can be customised to suit your requirements. If you have Subdomains, you can also customise the menu structures for each of the Subdomains. </p>
        <p>Menus are customised by navigating to <strong>Settings &gt; Menu</strong>. Understandably, the menu structure is a restricted area of the CLS that most Users are not permitted to change. If you are unable to access this area please talk with your Account Manager or the Client Services team. </p>
        <p>Once you are at the Menu Settings page, you see the code that specifies menus. You can customise this code to reorder or delete menu items and to add menu items that lead externally or to Custom Pages. Note that if you want to rename an existing menu item, you would do this through <a href="../../D_Settings/String Resources/Introduction.htm">String Resources</a>. </p>
        <p>The menu code is written in XML, Extensible Markup Language. The XML standard describes structured data and makes it possible to electronically share it. It is somewhat similar to HTML and contains markup indicators, or tags surrounded by angle brackets (&lt; and &gt;).</p>
        <p>To understand the CLS menu’s XML code, start with the existing, standard CLS menu structure which has two main components:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
            <li>The <strong>Main</strong> Menu, affectionately called the <em>Hamburger</em>. </li>
            <p>This offers links to the primary categories of activity and information in the CLS.</p>
        </ol>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="2">
            <li>The <strong>Secondary</strong> menu</li>
            <p>This offers links to the separate categories of activities that are organised via the five primary categories.</p>
        </ol>
        <p>In the screenshot below:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
            <li>The Main Menu shows that <strong>Manage Learning</strong> has been selected</li>
            <li>The Secondary Menu shows that<strong> Manage CPD</strong> has been selected within Manage Learning.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You can also see various options that can be selected as part of managing CPD Plans: add, search, import, etc.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Menu/Menu Settings Introduction.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>Note that the Home screen has a different layout. It does not have a secondary menu at the left. Instead it has a menu at the top of the page:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Menu/Menu Settings Introduction_1.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>It is important to remember that this entire menu structure is not visible to all Users. This is because the Role(s) that a User holds limits what s/he can do and see in the CLS, see <a href="../../D_Settings/Roles/Roles Introduction.htm">Roles</a>.</p>
        <p>Note also that you can customise screen colours, styles and images via <a href="../../D_Settings/Styles and Images/Style and Images Introduction.htm">Styles &amp; Images</a> and also customise header and footer logos and links.</p>
        <p>To customise menus navigate to <strong>Settings &gt; Menu</strong>.</p>
