        <p>A workflow is a review system that allows the appointment of multiple reviewers during question development in order to manage the quality and approval process. Workflows can be attached to Questions, Resources and Stimulus. If checked a workflow status will display on the Stimulus details page only if the Stimulus is linked to an Assessment Module where a workflow status has been set. The workflow status can be changed by clicking on the widget highlighted in the screenshot below. Please be aware that transitions will only appear if the User has the correct permissions assigned through their role.</p>

        <p>Versioning is the assignment of unique version numbers to unique states of stimuli. Versions are made up of major and minor components. The major version is to the left of the decimal place, the minor to the right. For example 1.53 has a major version of 1 and a minor version of 53.</p>
        <p>If checked a Version field will appear on the details page of the Stimulus. The Version number will help to keep track of any changes made to the Stimulus.</p>
        <p>For further information please see the document on Versioning.</p>
