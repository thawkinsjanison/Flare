        <h1 class="Heading1">Tokens and how they work</h1>
        <p>HTML <b>tokens</b> are an important feature of Message Templates. They are used to insert information that is held in the system  into the email.</p>
        <p>For example, the template <i>Discussion – InappropriateBehaviour</i> is used for the email sent when people report an inappropriate comment or post in Discussion Forums. </p>
        <p>You can see below that the token [User.FullName] is in the first line.</p>
        <p>When the email is sent [User.FullName] is replaced by the full name of the User who reported the inappropriate comment, for example <i>John Doe</i>.</p>
        <p>Thus, the first line of the email message will be -<i> Person reporting inappropriate behaviour – John Doe</i></p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Message templates1/Tokens and how they work.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>Similarly, the second line of the message will be<i>- Email address of person reporting inappropriate behaviour – </i><a href="mailto:Jdoe@email.com.au" class="Hyperlink" style="font-style: italic;">Jdoe@email.com.au</a></p>
        <p>To see how a Message Template would appear in an email, you can select <b>Send test Email</b> to send a test email to a nominated email address. </p>
