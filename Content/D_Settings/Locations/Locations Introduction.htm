        <p>A <b class="b">Location</b> is a physical place. At this place there may be one or more <b class="b">Venues</b>. Thus, one Location can be linked to multiple Venues.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Locations/Locations Introduction.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;border-left-style: none;border-left-width: 1px;border-right-style: none;border-right-width: 1px;border-top-style: none;border-top-width: 1px;border-bottom-style: none;border-bottom-width: 1px;" />
        </p>
        <p>In the CLS face to face training is provided through <b class="b">Sessions</b>. In most circumstances, Sessions are assigned a Venue and this Venue is linked to a Location, see <a href="../../B_Manage Learning/Manage Sessions2/Add Session.htm">Add Session </a>for details. In order to provide maps and location instructions to Session attendees, the Venue must be linked to a Location that has been defined with a physical address.</p>
        <p>There are a number of ways to set up Venues and Locations:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Create a <a href="../../D_Settings/Venues/Add a Venue.htm">Venue</a> and create or edit its Location on the same screen.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Create a <a href="../../D_Settings/Locations/Add a Location.htm">Location</a>, then create a Venue and link it to the Location.</li>
             <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Use the <strong>QuickAdd Venue</strong> feature when you are creating a <a href="../../B_Manage Learning/Manage Sessions2/Add Session.htm">Session</a>. You can also create a Location at the same screen if required. </li>

        </ul>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Manage Locations</h2>
        <p>To manage Locations navigate to <b class="b">Settings&gt;Locations</b></p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Locations/Locations Introduction_1.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>There are two tabs: Active and Inactive. Click the tab to view the members of that list.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Locations/Locations Introduction_2.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="_Archive_a_Location"></a><b class="b">Archive</b><b class="b"> a Location</b>
        </h2>
        <p>You can change a Location from active to inactive and vice versa. Select <b class="b">Settings &gt; Locations</b> and find the Location name in either the Inactive or Inactive list.</p>
        <p>In the list of active Locations click the check box at the left of the Location and click <b class="b">Archive</b>. This makes the Location inactive and moves it to the Inactive list.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Locations/Locations Introduction_3.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;;" />
        </p>
        <p>Conversely, in the list of inactive Locations click the check box at the left of the Location and click <b class="b">Unarchive</b><b class="b">. </b>This moves it to the active list.</p>
        <p>An inactive Location cannot be linked to a Venue. </p>
        <p>Note that if you make a Location inactive and it is linked to a Venue, it remains linked to the Venue but is marked as inactive in the Venue’s edit form. The Venue remains in the system and available for allocation to a Session.</p>
