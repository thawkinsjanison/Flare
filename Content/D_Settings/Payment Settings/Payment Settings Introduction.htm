        <h1 class="Heading1">Payment Settings - Introduction</h1>
        <p>If you require the facility to apply payments to the learning you deliver then this is possible using the CLS <b>Payment</b> feature. Payments can be applied to one or more Catalogue Items once the settings have been configured in the Payment Settings area of the CLS.</p>
        <p>Payment Settings can be accessed by navigating to <b>Settings</b> &gt; <b>Payment Settings</b>.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Note: In the CLS credit card numbers are sent encrypted to the payment provider. The Janison CLS only stores the receipt number from the payment provider and the last 4 digits of the credit card number.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Merchant accounts</h2>
        <p>A merchant account is a type of bank account that allows businesses to accept payments by payment cards, typically debit or credit cards.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Payment gateways</h2>
        <p>A payment gateway is a server that is dedicated to linking websites and banks so that online credit card transactions can be completed. In this case, the payment gateway facilitates the transfer of information between the Janison CLS, and the Front End Processor or acquiring bank.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Paypal</h2>
        <p>The Janison CLS supports PayPal as the third party processor. For more information about PayPal account types please see the <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/helpcenter/helphub/article?solutionId=FAQ2347" target="_blank"><span class="Hyperlink">Paypal</span></a> website.</p>
