        <p>You have significant control over the way your site looks. For example, you can use your own logo on the top of the screen and your own image for the welcome screen. You can customise the footer. And because the CLS is a web application, you can also change the ‘skin’, that is, the colours of text, accents and backgrounds in the CLS screens. You can also add custom CSS to override other aspects of the way content is displayed on the screen. These settings all modify the aesthetics of the CLS environment and can be used to customise it to suit your organisation and its brand.</p>
