        <p>If a User completes learning outside the CLS but does not immediately log its completion in the CLS this enrolment can be backdated in the transcript to ensure it is included in the total learning that has taken place within a certain timeframe. In effect the completion date for the actual enrolment is replaced in the transcript by the completion date that was entered for the Other Learning.</p>
        <p>Steps involved:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 18pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Navigate to <b>Manage Learning</b> &gt; <b>Manage Learning Assets</b> and open the <b>Other Learning</b> asset involved.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/My Learning Transcript/Other learning.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 18pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Click <b>Edit Other Learning</b>.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Click the chevron to open <b>General Settings</b>.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Check the <b>‘Requires Completion / Qualification Date’</b> tick box. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/My Learning Transcript/Other learning_1.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 18pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Click <b>Save Other Learning</b>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When a User enters the required details for the Other Learning s/he is now required to enter a completion date. </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>It is this date that is displayed in the transcript, rather than the actual date that the enrolment in its linked Catalogue Item was completed. However, the latter is still held in the system.</p>
        <p>You can also customise what is shown under the Description heading in the transcript. If you make sure that Show Catalogue Item Description is set in My Learning Transcript settings, then the column headed Description will now contain the text that the User entered in the Other Learning’s Learner Submission Notes rather than the text in the description field for the Catalogue Item, as would usually be the case:</p>
