        <h1 class="Heading1">Reminder Notifications</h1>
        <p>Reminder notifications can be configured to notify Learners and Managers of Expiring and Due Dates. Multiple reminders can be set. You can delete rules using the x in the red circle. You can inactivate a rule by unticking the Active box.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Due date</h2>
        <p>The date by which a particular enrolment must be completed.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Expiry date</h2>
        <p>The date on which a previously completed enrolment will expire.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Valid to date</h2>
        <p>The date on which an external qualification or certification (such as a drivers licence) is valid to. This only applies to Other Learning assets.</p>
        <p>

        <h2 class="Heading2">How the rules work</h2>
        <p>The rules are executed once in a twenty four hour period. Each rule will only be executed once per enrolment. For example:</p>
        <p>If you have a rule that says “<i>Send an email notification if an enrolment is 1 week overdue</i>” and Jo (a user) has an enrolment. When Jo’s enrolment becomes more than 1 week overdue, a notification will be sent. The next day, the enrolment will still be more than 1 week overdue but another notification will not be sent because this rule has already run once for Jo’s enrolment.</p>
