        <h1>Purchase notifications</h1>
        <p>Purchases are only valid if the Self Enrolment Method in a Catalogue item is set to Self-enrolment (Paid). With this configuration, the Additional Purchase Options section will appear in the Catalogue item. The email notifies that an additional purchase was made by the user. For example, you may offer a first aid manikin to users who are doing the first aid course. This email may go to the ‘warehouse email address’ who can then send the hat to the user.</p>
