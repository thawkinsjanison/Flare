        <h1>Reminder notifications</h1>
        <p>Reminder notifications can be configured to notify learners and managers of expiring and due dates. Multiple reminders can be set. You can delete rules using the <img src="../../Resources/Images/Email Settings2/Reminder notifications.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 18px;height: 17px;" /> next to the required rule. You can inactivate a rule by clearing the Active box.</p>
        <h2>Due date</h2>
        <p>Reminders can be set to notify learners or managers on, before or after the date by which a particular enrolment must be completed.</p>
        <h2>Expiry date</h2>
        <p>Reminders can be set to notify learners or managers on, before or after the date on which a previously completed enrolment will expire.</p>
        <h2>Valid to date</h2>
        <p>Reminders can be set to notify learners or managers on, before or after the date on which an external qualification or certification (such as a drivers licence) is valid to. This only applies to Other Learning assets.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h2>How the rules work</h2>
        <p>The rules are executed once in a twenty-four hour period. Each rule will only be executed once per enrolment. For example:</p>
        <p>If you have a rule that says “Send an email notification if an enrolment is 1 week overdue” and Jo (a user) has an enrolment. When Jo’s enrolment becomes more than 1 week overdue, a notification will be sent. The next day, the enrolment will still be more than 1 week overdue but another notification will not be sent because this rule has already run once for Jo’s enrolment.</p>
