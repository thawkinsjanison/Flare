        <p>Email Settings&#160;offers the option to set whether email notifications are sent from the system to users in a variety of situations. </p>
        <p>To configure&#160;these notifications&#160;browse to&#160;<b>Settings</b>&#160;&gt;&#160;<b>Email Settings</b>.</p>

        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
            <li>Email History allows system admins to examine the details of emails that have been sent through the system. Email History is not available to tenant admins.&#160; If you require information on sent emails you will need to contact the Janison Helpdesk team.</li>
        </ol>

        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="2">
            <li><b>Default From Address</b> is set to no-reply@janison.com.au.&#160; End users who receive emails will see this address as the sender.&#160; If any changes to this address are required please contact the Janison Helpdesk team as background changes outside of this system will be required in additional to changing this field.</li>
            <li><b>Application URL</b> applies in the case where you are using your own domain URL to access the Janison site. You can enter your URL here and emails containing links will contain the correct URL.&#160; An example of this is if a marker receives an email with a link to mark a test attempt.&#160; The link will contain your domain instead of the actual Janison URL of the site.</li>
            <li><b>Block all emails</b> will block all emails from being sent except for user account emails e.g. password retrieval and registration. This can be used as a safeguard during testing. </li>
            <li><b>Per-user notifications</b> is required if you have a daily digest scheduled task. This will send out summary emails notifying users of new content, events and recommended content. </li>
        </ol>
