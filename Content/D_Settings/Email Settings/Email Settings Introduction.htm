        <h1>Email Settings Introduction</h1>
        <p>Email Settings offers the option to set whether email notifications are sent from the system to users in a variety of situations.</p>

            <li>Email History allows system admins to examine the details of emails that have been sent through the system. Email History is not available to tenant admins. If you require information on sent emails you will need to contact Janison Support at the Helpdesk. </li>

            <li>Default From Address is set to <a href="mailto:no-reply@janison.com.au"><span class="Hyperlink">no-reply@janison.com.au</span></a>. End users who receive emails will see this address as the sender. If any changes to this address are required please contact the Janison Helpdesk team as background changes outside of this system will be required in addition to changing this field.</li>
            <li>Block all emails will block all emails from being sent except for user account emails e.g. password retrieval and registration. This can be used as a safeguard during testing.</li>
            <li>Per-user notifications are required for many parts of the system to send emails.</li>
            <li>Application URL applies in the case where you are using your own domain URL to access your Janison sites. When you enter an Application URL against one of your Tenants or Subtenants that URL will be used within Message Templates which contain links. An example of this is if a marker receives an email with a link to mark a test attempt. The link will contain the Application URL you entered instead of the actual Janison URL of the site.</li>
