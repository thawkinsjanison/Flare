        <h1 class="Heading1">Custom Attributes and Self Enrolment Questions</h1>
        <p><i>Custom Attribute Sets</i> containing one or more <i>Custom Attributes</i> can be used to collect information from Users when they self-enrol in a Catalogue Item. These Custom Attribute Sets are referred to as <i>Question Sets</i> in Catalogue Items.</p>
        <p>Question Sets could be used to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gather information on dietary requirements for a Training Session.</li>
            <li>Gather data such as geographical location or age range of enrolees.</li>
            <li>Find out how Learners are finding the courses you offer. This may be of assistance for marketing purposes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To create a Question Set:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
            <li>
			Create a Custom Attribute Set and add one or more Custom Attributes with appropriate fields for the data you want to collect. Note that the Custom Attributes do not need to be linked to any Objects.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Below is an example of two Custom Attributes in a Custom Attribute Set. A <b>List</b> type has been used in this example but any Custom Attribute type can be used.		</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Custom Attributes/Custom Attributes and Self.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;mc-thumbnail: none;" class="Thumbnail" />
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="2">
            <li>Browse to your Catalogue Item, enter edit mode and open the Self Enrolment Settings section. In the Enrolment Question Set drop-down, select your question set and Save the Catalogue Item.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Custom Attributes/Custom Attributes and Self_1.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Learners enrolling in the Catalogue item will be presented with the questions as shown below.</p>
        <p> <img src="../../Resources/Images/Custom Attributes/Custom Attributes and Self_2.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;mc-thumbnail: none;" class="Thumbnail" /></p>
        <p><b>Note</b>: Learners will only be presented with the question sets if the <b>Self Enrolment Method</b> does not involve auto enrolment. For example if the Self Enrolment Method is set to <i>No approval, enrol and launch immediately</i>, Learners will bypass the question set and be taken straight to the Learning Asset.</p>
        <h2>Reporting on Enrolment Question Sets</h2>
        <p>To view the data collected from the Question Set, a report can be created using Enrolment as the entity.</p>

        <p>Below is an example of the report output. For further information on how to create reports please see the document on <a href="../../B_Manage Learning/Customisable Reports/Customisable reports introduction.htm">Customisable Reports</a>.</p>
