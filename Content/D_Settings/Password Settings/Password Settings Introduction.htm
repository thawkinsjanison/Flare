        <h1 class="Heading1">Password Settings â€“ Introduction</h1>
        <p>You can help protect your site by customising your password policy settings, including:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Requiring Users to change their password regularly, </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Specifying a minimum length for passwords, and </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Requiring passwords to meet certain complexity requirements. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>At Janison we always recommend having a strong password policy. We recommend using at least the default password settings that were set up when your site was first established. Alternatively you may choose to make the password settings even stronger.</p>
        <p>To manage password settings go to <b>Settings</b> &gt; <b>Password Settings</b>.</p>

        </p>
        <p>There are five separate aspects that you can set. Click the chevron next to each one in order to see and edit the settings.</p>
