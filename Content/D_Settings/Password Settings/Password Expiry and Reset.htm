        <h1 class="Heading1">Password Expiry and Reset Policy</h1>
        <p>You can make a User's password expire after a certain number of days or set the password to never expire. You can also change the number of days Users must wait before they can change their passwords. In addition, the Password expiry time can be configured differently per Role.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The number entered into this field limits the time the Users must wait between changes to their password. For example an interval of ‘1’ day would limit a User to 1 password change per day and an interval of ‘2’ would limit a User to 1 password change every 2 days.</p>
        <p>In the screenshot below the interval has been set to 30 days. When the User attempts to change their password more than once during this period the message below is presented to them. The text can be customised if required in String Resources. Please see the document on String Resources for further details.</p>

        <p>If this option is checked and your Role permits you to make changes, you will be required to enter your password in order to change the passwords of other Users.</p>

        <p>Enter a value in the Default validity period field to specify when the system will force a password reset for Users. This expiry period can be customised for particular roles using the Role drop-down as shown in the screenshot above. In this example the Facilitator role has been set to expire after 30 days. All other User passwords will expire in 90 days.</p>
        <p>Below is the screen a User will encounter when their password expires. The text <i>Your password has expired. You need to set a new password</i> is a <a href="../String Resources/Introduction.htm" target="_self">String Resource</a> and can be customised if required.</p>
