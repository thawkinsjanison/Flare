        <h1 class="Heading1">Complexity Rules</h1>
        <p>If Complexity Rules are enabled, passwords will need to meet the minimum requirements when they are created or changed. There are several options available to increase password security. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Password Settings/Complexity Rules.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">No minimum complexity</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Password Settings/Complexity Rules_1.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>If this is selected passwords will not be required to meet any complexity rules. This setting is not recommended as it allows Users to choose weak passwords that will make their accounts vulnerable. For example passwords that contain only alphanumeric characters are extremely easy to discover using several publicly available tools.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Passwords must meet minimum complexity</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Password Settings/Complexity Rules_2.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>If enabled passwords must meet the minimum requirements specified in the options below when created or changed.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Minimum password length</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Password Settings/Complexity Rules_3.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>A numerical value is required in this field which will enforce the minimum length of a password. In this example passwords are required to be 5 characters or more.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Require an upper case letter</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Password Settings/Complexity Rules_4.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>At least one upper case letter is required, for example A, B, C.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Require a number</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Password Settings/Complexity Rules_5.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>At least one number is required, for example 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Require a symbol</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Password Settings/Complexity Rules_6.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>At least one symbol found on the keyboard is required, for example&#160; !, @, #, $, %.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Use generated password strength hint</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Password Settings/Complexity Rules_7.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>This option should be selected if the complexity rules are left as the system default because the text matches the default settings. The message on the Change Password screen will appear as in the screenshot below.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Password Settings/Complexity Rules_8.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Use custom password strength hint</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Password Settings/Complexity Rules_9.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>This option should be selected if the complexity rules have been changed and therefore the hint needs to be changed to match. As above, the message on the Change Password screen will appear with the new text entered into this field.</p>
