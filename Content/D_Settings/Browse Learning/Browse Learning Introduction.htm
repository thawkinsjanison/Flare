        <h1 class="Heading1">Browse Learning Introduction</h1>
        <p><b>Browse Learning</b>&#160;links to a catalogue of the <b>Learning Assets</b> available to learners.&#160; The Learning Assets are linked to Catalogue Items which are listed on the Browse Learning page as tiles. It is accessed from the <b>Browse Learning</b> menu when on the home page of the site.</p>
        <p>By default the Learning Assets are listed on the page without any categorisation. In the screenshot below Browse Learning is shown in its default state.</p>

        </p>
        <p>This is suitable if only a few Catalogue Items exist in the system. If there are many Catalogue Items it makes sense to group them into topics to prevent them from appearing in one long list. This can be achieved in <b>Browse Learning Settings</b>. The outcome can be a left hand menu structure as shown below.</p>
