        <h1 class="Heading1">How this role compares to other roles</h1>
        <p>This section has the functionality for Administrators to compare a selected Role to other Roles in 3 different ways:</p>
        <p>Actions allowed in other roles but not in this role.</p>
        <p>Actions denied in other roles but not in this role.</p>
        <p>Actions in other roles with effective access different to one in this role.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Roles1/How this role compares to.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>In the below example we have opened the <b>Basic User</b> Role and have clicked the <b>Actions allowed in other roles but not in this role link</b>.&#160; By doing this we are going to determine what additional access any other roles has compared to the Basic User. In this example we are looking at the <b>Content Designer</b> Role. When Expanding <b>Areas</b> of the Role, we can see all the Areas the <b>Content Designer</b> has access to which the <b>Basic User</b> does not. For example Content Designer has access to the <b>Asset Browser</b> and <b>File browser</b>. The <b>Basic User</b> does not have access to these Areas.</p>

        </p>
        <p>If we open the <b>Super Administrator</b> Role and expanded the <b>Actions allowed in other roles but not in this role</b> link, there would be nothing listed in any of the other Roles as the Super Administrator Role has full permissions to every feature available in the system.</p>
