        <p>A Role is a collection of rights that can be assigned to Users and determines what they can see and do in the system. Users have one <b>Main Role</b> and they may be allocated a number of <b>Extra Roles</b> that give them rights over particular entities in the CLS. Users never see more functions than they need to use. For example, someone with the additional <b>Marker</b> Role can mark Tests but canâ€™t change Courses and Enrolments or manage Users. A User with a System Administrator Role can do and see everything.</p>
        <p>The Security Manager Plugin provides a set of User Interface screens for an administrator and other authorised people to configure Roles to manage access controls.</p>
        <p>Managing Roles in the system is not a trivial task, and will usually be completed by the Janison Client Services team. </p>
        <p>Roles are managed through <b>Settings</b> &gt; <b>Roles</b>.</p>
