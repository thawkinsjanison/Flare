        <h1 class="Heading1">User Extra Roles Widget</h1>
        <p>The User Extra Roles Widget provides the ability for authorised Users to view and manage extra roles for a given User directly from the Userâ€™s profile. The widget is available from the User detail screen only.</p>
        <p>The Widget is divided into 2 sections:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
            <li>A section listing their existing Extra Roles. Extra Roles can be removed here by clicking the - icon.</li>
            <li>A section to add Extra Roles.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Roles1/User Extra Roles Widget.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>In the screenshot above the Main Role of the User is Basic User. The User is only required to be the marker for certain Learning Assets. Setting them as a Marker as their Main Role would give them access to mark all learning on the site. Applying the Marker Role as an Extra Role limits their access to mark only the stipulated Learning Assets.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Roles1/User Extra Roles Widget_1.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>Another example for the use of the widget could be to set a Content Designer for a discipline.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Roles1/User Extra Roles Widget_2.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>This would give them access to the Design Menu and anything related to the Discipline they are assigned to. In this example Discipline 1.</p>

        <h2 class="Heading2">Finding the User Extra Role to meet your requirements</h2>
        <p>Finding the correct rights to assign to a user may take some trial end error. Here are some steps you can take to help you achieve the required outcome.</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">With the admin account create a test user with a Main Role of Basic User.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Log into the system with this test account. Note that you will need to use a different browser or use a new identity in the same browser.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Logged in with the admin account assign an Extra Role to the test User.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Refresh the page of the test user and examine the access change to determine if it is as required.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">If not you may need to try another User Extra Role or alternatively adjust the Securable areas of the application for the role you have selected.</li>
        </ul>
