        <h1 class="Heading1">Why can't I edit someone?</h1>
        <p>The Janison CLS enforces a business rule where one user can never edit another user that has more rights. For example, a Content Administrator would not be able to edit the profile for a Tenant Administrator. This ensures that it is never possible for any user to hi-jack system access by, for example, changing another userâ€™s email address, or resetting their password.</p>
        <p>Note that there is an email validation process whereby users are not able to change an email address without validating through their own email address.</p>
