        <h1 class="Heading1">What does this Rule enrol users for?</h1>
        <p>This section gives you the option to select one or more Catalogue Items for the enrolment rule. It also provides settings for controlling due and expiry dates as well as reenrol Intervals.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/User Enrolment Rules/What does this Rule enrol.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Catalogue Item</h2>
        <p>To add a Catalogue Item to the rule:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
            <li>Use the drop-down to select the required Catalogue Item.</li>
            <li>Click the <b>Add</b> button.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To remove a Catalogue Item click the <img src="../../Resources/Images/User Enrolment Rules/What does this Rule enrol_1.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" /> icon.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/User Enrolment Rules/What does this Rule enrol_2.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>Note that multiple Catalogue Items can be added if required.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">No due Date</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/User Enrolment Rules/What does this Rule enrol_3.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>This setting will not specify a due date on the Catalogue Item. The Catalogue Item or Items can be completed at any time.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Due date after a period</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/User Enrolment Rules/What does this Rule enrol_4.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>The period entered here will specify a date when the learning is due to be completed. The learner will see the due date on the catalogue tile when they access their <b>My Learning</b> page.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/User Enrolment Rules/What does this Rule enrol_5.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Absolute Due date</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/User Enrolment Rules/What does this Rule enrol_6.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>This field functions the same as the above <i>Due date after a period</i>, the difference being an absolute date is set.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Expiry Date</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/User Enrolment Rules/What does this Rule enrol_7.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>Use this option if this learning expires after some time, and Users must re-do it in order to keep their learning up to date. In the above example the <b>Apply First Aid</b> will expire 2 years after completion. The learner will see the expiry date on the catalogue tile when they access their My Learning page.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/User Enrolment Rules/What does this Rule enrol_8.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Reenroll Interval</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/User Enrolment Rules/What does this Rule enrol_9.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>The time frame set here will determine when the enrolment rule will re-enrol the User in the Catalogue Item after the first enrolment. By combining the two example settings above, the learner will be automatically re-enrolled by the re-enrolment rule in 23 months. This means that the learner will be able to access and complete the Catalogue Item before it expires.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Notify Users</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/User Enrolment Rules/What does this Rule enrol_10.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>If this option is checked, learners will receive a notification when the enrolment rule is run and they are enrolled in the Catalogue Item. The Message Template used for this email is the <i>Enrolment-LearnerConfirmation</i>.</p>
        <p><b>Note</b>: Reminder notifications can be configured to notify Learners and Managers of Expiring and Due Dates. For further information please see the document on <a href="../Email Settings/Reminder Notifications.htm">Reminder notifications</a>.</p>
