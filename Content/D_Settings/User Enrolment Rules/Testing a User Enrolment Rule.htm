        <h1 class="Heading1">Testing a User Enrolment Rule</h1>
        <p>To ensure that you have the rule set up correctly and also to check who will be affected by the rule or to run the rule, a <b>Test</b> feature is available. </p>
        <p>To test an enrolment rule:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Navigate to <b>Settings</b> &gt; <b>User Enrolment Rules</b>.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Select the required enrolment rule.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Click <b>Test Action Rule</b>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/User Enrolment Rules/Testing a User Enrolment Rule.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>A page will open with 3 tabs:</p>
        <p><b>To Be Enrolled</b> – This will list the Users who will be enrolled when the rule is run.</p>
        <p><b>Already Enrolled</b> – This will list the Users who have already been enrolled when the rule was previously run.</p>
        <p><b>All</b> – Includes all Users.</p>
        <p>When you click <b>Run Now</b>, All Users listed under <b>To Be Enrolled</b> tab will be enrolled. If you do not click <b>Run Now</b>, the rule will enrol the Users when the system runs the Daily Check or when the User Registers, depending on what is set in <b>When should the rule apply</b>?</p>
