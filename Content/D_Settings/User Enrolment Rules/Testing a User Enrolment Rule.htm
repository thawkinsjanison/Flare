        <h1>Testing a User Enrolment Rule</h1>
        <p>To ensure that you have the rule set up correctly and also to check who will be affected by the rule or to run the rule, a <b>Test</b> feature is available. </p>
        <p>To test an enrolment rule:</p>
        <p>Browse to <b>Settings</b> &gt; <b>User Enrolment Rules</b>.</p>
        <img src="../../Resources/Images/User Enrolment Rules/Testing a User Enrolment Rule.png" />
        <p>1.	Find and Select an Enrolment Rule.</p>
        <img src="../../Resources/Images/User Enrolment Rules/Testing a User Enrolment Rule_1.png" />
        <ol start="2">
            <li>Select<b>Test Action Rule</b>.</li>
        </ol>
        <img src="../../Resources/Images/User Enrolment Rules/Testing a User Enrolment Rule_2.png" />
        <p>A page will open with 3 tabs:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li>
                <p>The <b>To Be Enrolled</b> tab shows the users who will be enrolled when the rule is run.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The <b>Already Enrolled</b> tab shows the users who have already been enrolled by this rule.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The <b>All</b> tab show both the users to be enrolled and those users already enrolled.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>If the list of users in the <b>To Be Enrolled</b> tab do not match the users you would like to, it is a good idea to return to the User Enrolment Rule and adjust the filter options before continuing.</p>
