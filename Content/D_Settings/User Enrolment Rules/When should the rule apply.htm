        </p>
        <p>There are 2 ways in which User Enrolment Rules can operate, when a learner registers in the system and/or when the system runs a daily check.</p>
        <h2>On Self Registration</h2>
        <p>One or more fields on the registration form can be used as the filter for the User Enrolment Rule. As the User registers the rule is triggered. For example if a User selects the Group <b>First Aid Officers</b> in the registration form, when they click the <b>Sign Up</b> button the rule will run and enrol them in the Catalogue Item specified in the rule.</p>
        <p>Please see the document on <a href="../User Settings/Self Registration form.htm">Self-Registration form</a> for further information on registration.</p>
        <h2>Daily Check</h2>
        <p>The daily check will be run by a system schedule which is set at the global level of the Tenant. This is usually set to run at 2 am daily.</p>
