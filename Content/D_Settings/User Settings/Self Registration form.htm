        <h2 class="Heading2">Using Groups to auto-enrol users into Catalogues</h2>
        <p>Group Type – setting a Group Type on the Self-Registration form allows for powerful functionality to be included enabling Users to be automatically enrolled into different Catalogue Items depending on their grouping. In the example we have used below you can enrol children in relevant courses depending on their age range.</p>
        <p>There are a number of steps involved in this process.</p>
        <p>Step 1 – Involves setting a Group Type (this will be the text you would like to appear on the Self-Registration form).</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Navigate to <b>Manage People</b> &gt; <b>Group Types</b> &gt; <b>Add Group Type</b>.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Create the new Group Type Name and add Groups before selecting <b>Save Group Type</b>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/User Settings/Self Registration form_6.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>Step 2 – Involves ensuring the Group Type appears on the Self-Registration form.</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Navigate to <b>Settings</b> &gt; <b>User Settings</b> &gt; <b>Self Registration Form</b>.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;"> Activate the <b>Group Type</b> drop-down menu and select the newly created Group Type. For the purpose of this example we have created a Group Type titled ‘<i>Your age range</i>’.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Click <b>Save Settings</b>. You will see the New Group Type appear in the field list above and will be checked automatically.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/User Settings/Self Registration form_7.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>Step 3 – Involves setting up User Enrolment Rules which links the Group Type to an automatic enrolment for a Catalogue Item.</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Navigate to <b>Settings</b> &gt; <b>User Enrolment Rules</b> &gt; <b>Add User Enrolment Rule</b>.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Enter a Name for the User Enrolment Rule.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Activate the drop-down menu <b>What does this Rule enrol users for</b> and select a Catalogue Item. This may be a course that you want certain Users automatically enrolled in when they self-register.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/User Settings/Self Registration form_8.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Add a filter to point to the Group you are referring to by using the <b>(Any Group)</b> field. In the example provided the value is the age range 10-12. This means that any Users that select the Group Type 10-12 years will automatically be enrolled in the Amazing Facts Course upon self-registration. See
                instructions about how to set these up at <a href="../../D_Settings/Building Filters/Filters Introduction.htm">Building Filters</a>. 
            </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">When should the rule apply, check <b>On Self Registration.</b></li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Click <b>Save User Enrolment Rules</b>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/User Settings/Self Registration form_9.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>On the Logon page click <b>Register</b> and check the Self-Registration form for the newly added information.</p>
