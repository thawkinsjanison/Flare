        <h1 class="Heading1">Introduction</h1>
        <p>In <strong>Settings &gt; Menu </strong>you can customise your CLS menu to alter the order of menu items, remove menu items and add Custom Pages. <strong>Settings &gt; Resources</strong> adds extra dimensions to this customisability. In <strong>Settings &gt; String Resources</strong> you can customise the CLS text, the My Learning Dashboard and links in the footer.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/String Resources/Introduction.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>There are five different things you can do with String Resources:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
            <li><b>Change particular labels and text.</b>
            </li>
       
        <p>You can change the actual terms used by the CLS so that they match those used in your organisation. You can also customise various instructions, warnings and messages. Such changes can make the application much more intuitive for your users. </p>
      
            <li><b>Translate all labels and text.</b>
            </li>
        
        <p>Entirely different languages can be used for all the labels and text, that is, for all the String Resources in the CLS. Such changes mean that the CLS can be presented in completely different languages, depending on the language that has been set for a particular User’s Browser.</p>
       
            <li><b>Inject a custom page into My Learning Dashboard.</b>
            </li>
      
        <p>You can develop a Custom Page and use it to customise the My Learning Dashboard. This is only available if the Smart Dashboard plugin is active.</p>
       
            <li><b>Customise the links in the footer of screens.</b>
            </li>
       
        <p>You can customise these links to create links to Custom Pages or to external sites.</p>
        
            <li><b>Hide Text</b>
            </li>
             <p>If Text is not part of the menu it can be hidden if required.</p>
        </ol>
       
        <p>The CLS has a default set of terminology, for example the primary categories are:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/String Resources/Introduction_1.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>Using String Resources you can change terms such as these and instead employ the language of your organisation, thus:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;"><em>Manage People</em> could read <em>Staff Admin</em>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You could also change the name of other constructs, thus:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">A <em>Group</em> could become a <em>Cohort</em>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can also change messages, thus:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">the error message <em>Circular dependency caused as {0} already exists in the parent-child hierarchy of this Competency Set </em>could be translated into terms that your organisation is more familiar with.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Janison CLS took a best-practice approach to managing string resources meaning that different instances of the same resource can actually be translated differently. This greatly improves translatability, but does result in some duplication of effort. Thus, the CLS allows you to change and edit terms, however it also requires that you change the term at each separate instance of its use. There is no global change that can be made. An example is the term competency or competencies where there around 80 references that would need changing:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/String Resources/Introduction_2.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>and so on… </p>
        <p>All together there are around 7000 resources that can be changed within the CLS. Thus, before starting to change term(s) you should consider:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">What screens are we using?</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Do we need to change all references to the term?</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">How much time and energy is required to make these changes?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You should also plan to:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Develop a glossary of changes</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Possibly develop some Help resources to match your own terminology as the Janison help resources might look quite different, depending on your changes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To edit the default String Resource terminology select <strong>Settings &gt; String Resources</strong>.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Important note about language settings</h2>
        <p>The CLS checks the User’s browser language setting to determine the String Resources delivered to the User. Make sure that browsers are set to the correct language e.g.to en-AU. How you change a browser’s language setting will differ from browser to browser.</p>
        <p>When you change String Resources, the CLS takes note of its own language settings and links the updated String Resources only to that language. Languages are set in the CLS via <strong>Settings &gt; Languages</strong>:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/String Resources/Introduction_4.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>Note that there is a difference between, say, English and English (Australian). Thus, if your user base potentially contains different English Cultures (e.g. English (Ireland) and English (Caribbean)) and you want your changes to target all English cultures, you must set the CLS to the parent category, English, before making changes to the String Resources:</p>
