        <p>Self-Enrolment Settings control the way learners enrol into Catalogue Items. For example Catalogue items can be set to allow enrolments without restriction or they can be set to require a payment to be made to access the learning. Other options are possible.</p>
        <p>There are two steps involved to make this feature active:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Make the types of enrolment methods available in <b>Self enrolment Settings</b>. This step will only be required once.</li>
            <li>Set up the enrolment type in the Catalogue Item.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To access the setting navigate to <b>Settings</b> &gt; <b>Self Enrolment Settings</b>.</p>
