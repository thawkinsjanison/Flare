        <h1 class="Heading1">Types of Self Enrolments</h1>
        <p>There are several enrolment types available, you may only need a single enrolment type for all of Your Catalogue items or you may require different types for some Catalogue Items.</p>
        <h2>Do not allow</h2>
        <p>As the name suggests this will allow learners to View the Catalogue Item details but will not allow them to enrol. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Self enrolment/do not allow.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Learners will see information about the Catalogue Item but the <b>Enrol</b> button will be hidden.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Self enrolment/types_3.png" />
        </p>
        <h2>Self Enrolment (Free)</h2>
        <p>This enrolment method allows learners to enrol themselves without any approval required. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Self enrolment/self enrolment free.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Learners will see the same information as a Catalogue Item set to <b>Do Not Allow</b> but will have a Button to <b>Enrol</b>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Self enrolment/types_1.png" />
        </p>
        <h2>Self-enrolment (Paid)</h2>
        <p>Users are allowed to enrol, but some sort of payment is required (Token Code, Pay Pal, , Credit Card).</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Self enrolment/types_4.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Learners will see the same page as the Self Enrolment (free), but when they click the <b>Enrol</b> button they will be taken though a payment wizard. See the document on <a href="../Payment Settings/Payment Settings Introduction.htm">Payment Settings</a> for information on how to set up the payment methods.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Self enrolment/types_5.png" />
        </p>
        <h2>No Approval</h2>
        <p>Learner can enrol without any approval</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Self enrolment/no approval.png" />
        </p>
        <p>No approval settings don’t differ much from the option Self-Enrolment (Free). </p>
        <p>If no approval is required we would recommend using Self-Enrolment (Free).</p>
        <h2>1-Step Approval (Manager)</h2>
        <p>Learner requests enrolment, their manager approves or reject</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Self enrolment/types_6.png" />
        </p>
        <p>This option is only applicable if <b>Positions</b> are set up on your system. See the document on <a href="../../A_Manage People/Positions/Positions Introduction.htm">positions</a> for further information.</p>
        <p>Learners will see the same page as the Self Enrolment (free), but when they click the <b>Enrol</b> button they will be taken though a <b>Approval Workflow</b> wizard.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Self enrolment/types_7.png" />
        </p>
        <h2>No approval, enrol and launch immediately</h2>
        <p>Learner is enrolled after selecting a catalogue item on the browse learning page and redirected to enrolment details page</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Self enrolment/types_10.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Learners will be automatically enrolled in the Catalogue Item and taken to the details page as in the screenshot below. No <b>Enrol</b> button will be encountered as in the other enrolment methods. Learners launch the learning by clicking a link in the page.</p>
