        <h2>1. Do not allow Enrolment Methods to be set at Catalogue Item level</h2>
        <p>Depending on the <b>Default Enrolment Method</b> selected from the drop-down, all Catalogue Items in the system will function the in the same way. For example if <b>No approval, enrol and launch immediately</b> is selected, when learners enrol, they will not require approval for enrolment and will be enrolled when they open the Catalogue Item. There will be no option for administrators to change this method of enrolment at the Catalogue level.</p>
        <h2>2. Allow Enrolment Method override per Catalogue Item</h2>
        <p>If this option is selected, an additional section, <b>Self Enrolment Settings</b> will become available in Catalogue Items. The option to select any active enrolment types will be available. The <b>Default Enrolment Method</b> will be the enrolment method set when the Catalogue Item is created. Other options will be available in the drop-down.</p>
