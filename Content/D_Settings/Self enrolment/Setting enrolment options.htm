        <h5 class="Heading1">Setting enrolment options to appear at catalogue level</h5>
        <p>If you want a variety of different enrolment settings you can set Enrolment rules at individual catalogue items. An example of this is if you have a mixture of free courses and paid courses. You will need to Allow this setting under Self-Enrolment Settings.</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Navigate to the Settings menu. </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Select Self Enrolment Settings. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Tick ‘Allow Enrolment Method override per Catalogue Item’. This means that when you select an option at the Catalogue level it will override the default setting. <br /><img src="../../Resources/Images/Self enrolment/Setting enrolment options.png" /></p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">You will need to tick off which options you want to be allowed to set at the Catalogue level.</li>
        </ul>
