        <p>You can set up rules to precisely define <strong>parts</strong> of a CLS entity. These rules are called <strong>filters</strong> in the CLS They can very precisely select members of an entity because they are combined using Boolean logic, which can also be nested. This will be best understood by someone who is comfortable with: </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Boolean operations (AND, OR, NOT), </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">its language (e.g. “!” means “NOT”), and </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">how nesting limits scope</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you understand these go straight to <a href="Building Filters.htm#_Building_Filters"><span class="Hyperlink">Building Filters</span></a>, otherwise start with a <a href="Easier introduction to filters.htm#_Filters_1"><span class="Hyperlink">very basic introduction</span></a>.</p>
