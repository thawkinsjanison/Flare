                <p>The usual method of creating a Test is via <b class="b">Desi</b><b class="b">gn &gt; Tests and Surveys</b><b class="b"> &gt; </b><b class="b">Add Test</b>. </p>
                <p>However, if you check this option then the  <a href="../../B_Manage Learning/Add Learning/Step 3 Details for Test.htm">Add Learning Wizard</a> can also be used to create a Test. </p>
                <p>The Add Learning wizard simplifies the process of creating an enrollable Assessment Test, however it does limit the options a little. The main differences are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Question banking is disabled.</li>
                    <li>It isn’t possible to search for pre-existing Questions to add to a Test.</li>
                    <li>Unlinking a Question from a Test also deletes the Question altogether.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>See <a href="../../B_Manage Learning/Add Learning/Step 3 Details for Test.htm">Step 3 Details for Test</a> for more details.</p>
                <p>When you turn this setting on, in effect you are selecting a more basic implementation of assessment and a number of other Test Designer settings are disabled. You will notice, for example, that the four settings below this setting become unavailable when you check this one.</p>

                <p>Click the <b class="b">General Assessment Options</b> collapsible window to see this option.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/Test designer settings1/General Assessment Options_2.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
                </p>
                <p>Questions are created as members of a Module and by default Question banks are enabled. This means that once a Question has been created, it can be linked to and unlinked from any Tests and Test Sections in the same Assessment Module that it belongs to. So Questions can be re-used in all such entities that belong to the same Module.</p>
                <p>However, if you disable Question Banking then when you unlink a Question from a Test/Test Section the Question is also deleted from the CLS. In this situation you will be warned by the following dialogue box:</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/Test designer settings1/General Assessment Options_3.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
                </p>
                <p>Disabling Question Banking hides some authoring functionality from the Test Author in order to reduce complexity and accelerate development. This assumes that Users do not want the complexity that comes with a managed Question Bank and reusing Questions. </p>

                </p>
                <p>If this is checked then the functionality to manage Psychometric datasets is enabled and a Psychometric Data widget will be available in the widget bar for a Question details page. </p>
                <p>When appropriate Users click the widget they activate a pop up box displaying any psychometric data linked to the Question.</p>
                <p>Psychometric data is a more complex form of metadata that measures the performance of a Question. Additional complexities are:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
                    <li>For each Test administration, there will be one set of metadata.</li>
                    <li>Some psychometric data is per each response for multiple choice items.</li>
                    <li>Multiple administrations of psychometric data need to be displayed on the screen simultaneously.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A psychometric data set is similar to a Custom Attribute Set in that it contains the definition of fields that apply to Questions, and is applied at the Discipline level.</p>
