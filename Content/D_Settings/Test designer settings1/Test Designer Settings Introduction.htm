        <p>To handle this range of activities, the <b class="b">Test Designer </b>settings allow you to tailor the level of assessment sophistication and functionality to meet your needs. </p>
        <p>To access these settings navigate to <b class="b">Settings &gt; Test Designer Settings.</b></p>
