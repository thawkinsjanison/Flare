        <p>A Stimulus is a resource composed of one or more images, texts, videos, etc. Stimuli can be linked to Questions that are part of Assessment modules.</p>
        <p>When a Stimulus is linked to a Question, some or all of it (depending on its setup) appears at the side of the Question along with two chevrons. The student clicks the chevrons to bring the Stimulus fully on to and off the Question screen. </p>

        <p>A Stimulus can provide supplementary information, instructions, images, etc as desired. It can be composed of a number of resource types including audio, video, image, html etc, and one Stimulus can contain multiple items. </p>
        <p>A Stimulus is linked to a Question through the Question's details screen. Note that you can only link a Stimulus to a Question if they are both in the same (Assessment) Module. </p>
        <p>There is only one copy of a Stimulus in the system so any changes made to it will be appled to all the Questions it is linked to.</p>
        <p>You can customise your implementation of Stimuli at <a href="../../D_Settings/Resource designer settings/Stimulus Options.htm">Stimulus Settings</a>.</p>
        <p>Stimuli are managed by navigating to <strong>Design &gt; Stimuli</strong></p>
