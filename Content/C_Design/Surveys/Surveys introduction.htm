        <p>A survey is a very useful tool for gathering information and feedback from a large group of people. There are two ways a survey can be used within the CLS.&#160; These are:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Surveys added to a module of a course player – are limited to two question types and are useful for the capture of feedback about specific modules.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Surveys added to a survey player – have additional functionality and would be used to gather broader feedback for example, about the overall learning experience of the site. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Surveys can be found by navigating to Design &gt; Tests and Surveys.<br /><img src="../../Resources/Images/Surveys/Surveys introduction.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" /></p>
