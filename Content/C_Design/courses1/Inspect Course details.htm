        <h1 class="Heading1">Inspect Course details</h1>
        <p>Inspecting a Course gives you access to information about it and links to its Discipline, Modules and Competencies. To inspect a Course navigate to Design &gt; Courses and click the Course name. This takes you to its details screen. </p>
        <p>The name of the Course and the Discipline it belongs to (a clickable link) are listed at the top left hand side. </p>
        <p>The widget bar is underneath this. Of particular importance are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Tags – Courses can be tagged as a way of categorising and locating them, see linking Tags for instructions on how to do this.</li>
            <li>The next section displays the Name and Identifier of the Course and indicates whether the Course is Active. </li>
        </ol>
