        <h1 class="Heading1">Courses – Introduction</h1>
        <p>In the CLS there are a number of different types of Learning Assets such as Courses, Trackable Documents and Learning Events. Learners are enrolled in a Catalogue Item that is linked to one or more of these Learning Assets.</p>
        <p>Courses are containers for learning content (text, images, video, etc) and they are created within the CLS. However, Courses are actually linked to the learning content through links to Learning Modules that are in the same Discipline. These Modules contain the Pages (and Panels) that learners see in the Course Player. These Panels can also be linked to Tests, Surveys and Questions that belong to the same Module. </p>
        <p>The diagram below shows these relationships.</p>
