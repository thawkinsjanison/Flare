        <ol start="1">
            <li>If there is only one Course in the Catalogue Item and it has one Learning Module, they go straight to the Course Player showing the first Page of the Module:</li>

        <ol start="2">
            <li>If there is one Course in the Catalogue Item and it has multiple Learning Modules, they go to a screen showing tiles for each Module. They click on a Module’s tile and go to the Course Player showing the first Page of this Module:</li>

        <ol start="3">
            <li> If there is more than one Learning Asset linked to the Catalogue Item (technically, linked to a Program), then they go to a screen that lists the Learning Assets and enables them to launch them individually. Clicking a Course takes them to options 1 or 2 above, as appropriate.</li>
