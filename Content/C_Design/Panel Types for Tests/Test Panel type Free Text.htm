        <h1 class="Heading1">Test Panel type –Free Text (assessable)</h1>
        <p>The Free text (assessable) Panel works with a Test that includes one or more Short Answer Questions where learners write text that cannot be automatically marked. Thus, the Test must have its marking option set to Manual and a Pass mark set. </p>
        <p>In the Course Player, the learner writes text in the Question box and clicks Submit. A message then appears indicating that this has been submitted for marking and to await feedback from the marker. </p>
        <p>Once the Test has been marked the message will change and reveal the outcome of marking. If it’s a pass, the green completion tick will appear on the navigation thumbnail for this Page</p>
