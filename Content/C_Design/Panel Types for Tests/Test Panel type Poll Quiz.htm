        <h1 class="Heading1">Test Panel type –Poll Quiz</h1>
        <p>The Poll Quiz panel is designed for learner self-reflection rather than gathering survey information. It works with a Test that includes one or more Multiple Choice questions. Other Test question settings can be left as default. The Page is complete once the learner has answered the Questions.</p>
        <p>In this example, the Multiple Choice Question below is linked to a Poll Quiz Panel type:</p>
