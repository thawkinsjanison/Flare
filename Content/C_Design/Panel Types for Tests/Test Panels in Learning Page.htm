        <h1 class="Heading1">Test Panels in Learning Page Modules </h1>
        <p>A Test Panel type allows you to add a Test and Questions to your learning Module Page. You would do this to in order to make learning more interactive and engaging and to measure a learner’s progress. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Panel Types for Tests/LearnTest.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square; border-style:none;" />
        </p>
         
        <p>There are a number of types of Test Panel. Each one has different characteristics and can only work with specific types of Questions. Most require interaction before the Page is considered complete and its thumbnail given a green tick. Most Panels also give some kind of feedback and there can be extra feedback built into the Question itself. </p>
        <p>The Panel Types Micro Quiz (system) and Free Text (assessable) also require that the learner actually achieves a Test pass mark before the Page is considered complete. </p>
        <p>All these details are included in the instructions in this section for the individual Test Panel Types.</p>
        <p>Creating a Test Panel essentially involves:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">creating a Panel on a Page in a Learning Module (see <a href="../../C_Design/Modules2/Add a Panel to a Page.htm"><span class="Hyperlink">Add a Panel to a Page</span></a> for details)</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">choosing one of the Test Panel types for the Panel from the Content Template drop-down menu. In the example below it is a Micro-Quiz (system). </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">linking to a Test (which adds its linked Questions) using the Test drop-down menu. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Panel Types for Tests/Test Panels in Learning Page.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>Naturally the Tests in the drop-down list must be in the same Module as the Page. There can be one or more Questions in the Test. </p>
        
        <p>You can also add a new Test and/or edit the selected Test through this screen.</p>
        <p>Overall, there are five types of Question available in a Learning Module:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Match</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Multiple choice</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Multiple Choices</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Sequence</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Short Answer</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note that for more serious assessment you should create an <a href="../../C_Design/Assessment Module Tests/Tests Introduction.htm">Assessment Module Test</a> where there is an assessment infrastructure and a much larger number of Question types.</p>
