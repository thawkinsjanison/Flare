        <p>The Survey Quiz Panel is a tool for collecting feedback from learners. Instead of a Test, it works with a Survey, containing one or more Multiple Choice or Short Answer questions. </p>
        <p>In the Course Player, learners enter answers and click Submit. The system acknowledges this, thanks them and the Page is marked as complete.</p>
