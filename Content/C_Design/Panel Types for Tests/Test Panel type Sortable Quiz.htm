        <p>The Sortable Quiz panel works with a Test that includes a Sequence Question. Marking Options must be set to Automatic and a Pass Mark needs to be entered. All other Test settings can be left as default. </p>
        <p>In the Sequence Question, set the Display Order for the Answers to be the order you want learners to see them in the Panel.</p>

        <p>They drag the boxes to create an order and click Submit. They are given feedback on their choices. If they are incorrect they can click Retry, reposition the boxes and submit again. They can make an infinite number of retries until they get the Question correct. The Page itself is complete once the learner has submitted one answer, correct or incorrect.</p>
