        <p>In the Course Player, learners see the each Question in the Test on a separate screen. They submit answers and the system provides feedback so that they know which answers are correct and which are incorrect. The Test is completed when correct responses are provided for all Multiple Choice and Multiple Choices questions. Short Answer questions are automatically marked as correct as soon as a response is entered. The Page is complete once the learner has answered the Questions, regardless of whether they are correct or incorrect.</p>
