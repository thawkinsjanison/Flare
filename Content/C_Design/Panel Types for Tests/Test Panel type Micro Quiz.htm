        <p>A Micro Quiz (system) Panel works with a Test that includes either Multiple Choice or Multiple Choices question types. </p>
        <p>Settings required for the Test are:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Marking Options must be set to Automatic.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">a Pass mark needs to be entered or a completion will not be registered</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">all other settings at the Test level can be left as default.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are several options for feedback for the Test Questions:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Single- enter a string of text that the learner sees if they are correct or incorrect.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">CorrectAndIncorrect- enter a string of text for correct and a string for incorrect. Learners receive the appropriate response.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Per Distractor- enter feedback for each possible answer (distractor). Regardless of whether they are correct/incorrect they will receive the feedback corresponding to their response.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">None- screen will display default text: Correct or Incorrect.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the Course Player, learners selects the option(s) they think correct and click Submit. They receive the feedback that has been specified for each Question. The Page is not marked as completed until they have clicked Retry and selected enough correct answers for the pass mark to be achieved. Once the Page is complete, the green tick will appear on the navigation thumbnail for it.</p>
