        <h1 class="Heading1">Test Panel type –Model Answers</h1>
        <p>The Model Answers panel is like a Free text Panel in that it works with a Test that includes one or more Short Answer Questions. However, in this Panel type, a model answer can be set for each Question so that learners get an indication of the correct answer. All settings at the Test level can be left as default. </p>
        <p>The Model Answer for each Question is entered in the Marking Rubric field in the expandable Marking section. All other settings for the Question can be ignored.</p>

        </p>
        <p>In the Course Player, the learner enters and saves a response and text entered in Marking Rubric displays on the screen under the heading: Model Answer. The Page is complete once they have entered some text.</p>
