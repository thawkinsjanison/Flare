        <h1 class="Heading1">Test Panel type –Match drag-n-drop</h1>
        <p>The Match Drag-n-Drop panel works with a Match Question type. The learner drags and drops items from a column labelled Definition into the appropriate second and third columns defined by the Match field of the Question. There is no correct or incorrect answer to the Question, once again the aim is reflection. All other settings at the Test level can be left as default. The Page is complete once the learner has interacted with it.</p>
        <p>In this example, the Match Question below is linked to a Match drag-n-drop Panel type:</p>

        </p>
        <p>In the Course Player, a learner can drag all of the items under Definition and in this example has already dragged two of them:</p>
