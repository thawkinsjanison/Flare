        <h1 class="Heading1">Test Panel type –Free Text Review </h1>
        <p>The Free Text Review panel is not assessable and gives learners a read only summary of the response previously entered for that Question in a Free Text Panel. The purpose is self-reflection, as learners have the opportunity to reconsider their earlier understandings.</p>
        <p>When selecting the Test from the drop-down menu, be sure to select a Test linked to a previous Free Text Panel.</p>
