        <h1 class="Heading1">Creating Questions for Panels</h1>
        <p>When a <strong>Question</strong> appears in a <strong>Learning Module</strong>, it can only do so as part of a Test<strong> Panel type</strong>, for example a Micro-Quiz. The Question appears on the learnerâ€™s screen because it is linked to a <strong>Test</strong> that functions with one of these Test Panel types. And this Panel may be arranged on the screen in combination with other Panels, in an infinite number of possible configurations.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
         <p>Thus, when we show a Question preview here, this is only the way the Question would look as a stand-alone. The Question will almost certainly look different in the Course Player, depending on the particular Panel layout it occurs in.</p>
        <p>To create a new question select <strong>Design &gt; Questions </strong> </p>

        <p>Select <strong>Add Test Question</strong> from the <strong>Actions</strong> drop-down menu.</p>

                <p>Match Questions are made up of one or more sets of: </p>

                </ul>
                <p>The candidate selects the correct match answer from a drop down list. </p>
                <p>If you include more than one set, each one must be answered correctly for the candidate to correctly answer the whole question.</p>

                <p>A Multiple Choices Question type allows the author to specify multiple answers that can be correct. The options can be text (as in the example below) or pictures.

Note that if Scoring Type is set to Correct/Incorrect (Point 5 below), the candidate must select all of the correct answers to be marked correct.
