        <p>Learning Modules are specialised for learning. Their Tests require less functionality and there are a limited number of Question types available. Questions are integrated in the Panels of Pages and are oriented towards enhancing and monitoring the learning experience.</p>
        <p>The Questions are presented to the Users in the Course Player as shown below. The Course Player contains learning material and may optionally contain one or more Tests.</p>
