        <p>The purpose of this document is to give you an overview of the differences between <b>Learning Module Tests</b> and <b>Assessment Module Tests</b>. You will find detailed information on these tests and the related question types in the below documents:</p>
        <p><a href="../Assessment Module Tests/Tests Introduction.htm">Assessment Module Tests</a>
        </p>
        <p><a href="../Assessment question types/Creating Questions.htm">Assessment Question Types</a>
        </p>
        <p><a href="../Learning Module Tests1/Creating a Test for a Learning.htm">Learning Module Tests</a>
        </p>
        <p><a href="../Panel Types for Tests/Test Panels in Learning Page.htm">Learning Questions Types (Panels)</a> <![CDATA[ ]]></p>
        <p>Tests are made up of one or more Questions and can be added to Learning or Assessment Modules in order to assess a learnerâ€™s knowledge. There is one way to create a Test but once the type of Module is selected the options in the Test creation form differ. See <a href="http://help.janison.com.au/Content/C_Design/Modules2/Modules%20Introduction.htm"><span class="Hyperlink">Modules</span></a> for more information.</p>
        <p>Note: An Assessment Test is added directly to a Catalogue item. Learning Tests on the other hand are added to Panels of Pages in a Module. A Module needs to be linked to a Course. The Course is then added to a Catalogue item.</p>
