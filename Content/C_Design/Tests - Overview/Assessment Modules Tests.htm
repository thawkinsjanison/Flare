        <p>Assessment Modules are specialised for assessment, so their Tests need to be powerful and multi-functional. Assessment Module Tests support a large number of Question types.</p>
        <p>The questions are presented to the Users in the Test Player as shown below. The Test Player has restrictions which by default do not permit the Users to navigate away from the test to other areas of the CLS. The Test Player only contains Test Questions.</p>
