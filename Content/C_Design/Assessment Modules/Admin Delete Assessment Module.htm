        <p>To delete an Assessment Module navigate to <strong>Design > Modules</strong> and click the Module name. This takes you to its details screen</p>
        
        <p>Click <b class="b">Admin Delete</b>.</p>

        </p>
        <p>This is a serious and irreversible action that also deletes the entities that are only part of this Module. The following list for an example Module indicates the range of entities involved:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assessment Modules/Admin Delete Assessment Module_1.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>Because of the seriousness of this action, a second, high-level Admin User is required to authorise the deletion.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assessment Modules/Admin Delete Assessment Module_2.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>If this person clicks <b class="b">OK</b> then the Module and all the entities that belong to it are permanently deleted.</p>
