        <h1 class="Heading1">Assessment Modules – Introduction</h1>
        <p>There are three different kinds of Modules in the CLS. These play different roles in the system and hence have different structures, see <a href="../Modules2/Modules Introduction.htm"><span class="Hyperlink">Modules - Introduction</span></a>. This section of the Help site covers <b class="b">Assessment</b> Modules, that is, Modules that are specialised for the assessment of knowledge. </p>
        <p>You create an Assessment Module as a kind of parent. It has Tests, Questions, Surveys and Media Resources that belong to it and various settings that can also be inherited, such as workflow settings and the Test Player’s skin. </p>
        <p>However, as the diagram shows, you do not link an Assessment Module to the Catalogue Item directly.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Instead, a Catalogue Item is linked to one or more Tests that <i class="em">belong</i> to Assessment Module(s) and are hence Assessment Tests. Candidates undergo assessment when they are enrolled in such a Catalogue Item and they encounter the Test(s) in the <b class="b">Test Player</b>. Note that a Catalogue Item can link to more than one Test, and these Tests do not all have to be in the same Assessment Module.</p>
        <p>Each Test is linked to one or more Questions that belong to the same Assessment Module. There are many types of Assessment Questions that can be created, see <a href="../Assessment question types/Creating Questions.htm">Assessment Question types</a>.</p>
        <p>Remember that when you create an Assessment Test you specify the Assessment Module that it belongs to. However, the Test must be directly linked to an enrollable Catalogue Item in order to be presented to the User in a Test Player; merely belonging to an Assessment Module will not present it in the Test Player. </p>
        <p>Modules are managed by selecting <b class="b">Design &gt; Modules</b>.</p>
