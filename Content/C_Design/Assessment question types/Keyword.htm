        <h1 class="Heading1">Keyword</h1>
        <p>In a Keyword question type candidates are asked to enter text to answer a question. The candidate can type a word or a phrase. They enter this via a free input text box which sits below the question. If the answer entered matches any of the correct answers that were specified (it is not case specific), it will be marked as correct.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Scoring</h2>
        <p>This question type is marked automatically.&#160; Score allocation is set by the author at the time of authoring.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Steps</h2>

        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">

        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="4">
            <li>Select either Correct/Incorrect or Per Distractor from the <b>Scoring Type</b> field. The first option scores the entire question, the second allows you to allocate different scores to different pairings.</li>
            <li>Set the size of the text box that candidates will see in <b>Expected Length</b> if desired .</li>
            <li>If an <b>Input Restriction</b> is selected from the drop-down box then candidates will only be able to enter the kind of text specified here. Click the Show hint for valid input check box if you want them to be informed about this</li>
            <li>Enter the possible answers under the Match section. Any of these responses the question will be marked as correct. For example:</li>
        </ol>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li>Sydney</li>
