        <h1 class="Heading1">Select Point Interaction </h1>
        <p>In a Select Point Interaction question type, candidates click to create one or more points on a background image and they are able to move these points once they have been created. They can create as many points as has been specified in Max choices (see below) and more than one of them can be a correct answer. The answer is correct if it is within a defined hotspot that has been set as correct.</p>
        <p>This question is very similar to Hotspot Interaction except that here the hotspots that have been set up by the question author are not visible to the candidate.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Scoring</h2>
        <p>This question type is marked automatically.&#160; Score allocation is set by the author at the time of authoring.</p>

            <li>Click the image icon to select image(s) from the available resources. This will be the optional background image.</li>
            <li>Hotspots are added by clicking the tool for a rectangular, circular or many-sided hotspot. For the first two you then drag out a shape, for the third you then click to add each vertex and click the first vertex again to close the shape. When no tool is selected the first two hotspot types can be dragged into new positions and proportions</li>

            <li>When the first hotspot is created (step 6) two new fields appear. Max and Min choices can be used to set the minimum and maximum number of selections a candidate can make. Candidates cannot submit their response until Min Choices is met. If the fields are empty this will be unregulated.</li>
            <li>Each time you add a hotspot, a new line also appears with required fields in red</li>
            <li>Enter a value in the Label column for the hotspot name</li>
            <li>Identify whether this hotspot is a correct answer by checking the box beside it in the Correct column</li>
            <li>You can delete a hotspot by clicking the red minus icon to its right. You can move the place of a row in the list by dragging the plus icon </li>
