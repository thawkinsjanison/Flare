        <h1 class="Heading1">Graphic order interaction</h1>
        <p>A graphic order interaction question asks a candidate to drag numbers onto defined and visible hotspots on an image in order to indicate a correct order. A hotspot will turn green when a number is dragged over </p>
        <p>This question type is very similar to other hotspot questions. The main difference is that instead of selecting correct hotspots, the candidate specifies the order of the hotspots.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Scoring</h2>
        <p>This question type is marked automatically.&#160; Score allocation is set by the author at the time of authoring.</p>

            <li>Hotspots are added by clicking the tool for a rectangular, circular or many-sided hotspot. For the first two you then drag out a shape, for the third you then click to add each vertex and click the first vertex again to close the shape. When no tool is selected the first two hotspot types can be dragged into new positions and proportions</li>
