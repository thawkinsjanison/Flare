        <h1 class="Heading1">Associate Interaction</h1>
        <p>An Associate Interaction question type asks candidates to create pairs of items using drag and drop. The pairings can be images or text (or a combination). This is a more powerful question type, because an item can be paired with more than one other item, leading to more complex assessments.</p>
        <p>A Match Interaction question type is similar to this one, however it starts off with one image/text already placed in each pair.</p>
        <p>Notes: </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li>Use the settings in Min/Max Associations (see 3. below), Match Min/Max (see 8. below) and Correct (see 9. below) to determine: the total numbers of pairs that candidates are permitted to create; the number of pairings they may create containing any individual item; and which of those multiple pairings are correct.</li>
            <li>When using images, it is best to check and adjust sizes before uploading, as re-setting height and width within the question may alter the image’s height to width ratio.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Scoring</h2>
        <p>This item type is marked automatically. Score allocation is set at the time of authoring.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Steps</h2>
        <p>Navigate to <b>Design &gt; Questions</b> and select <b>Add Test Question</b> from the <b>Actions</b> drop-down menu.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
            <li>Select the <b>Discipline</b> and <b>Module</b> that the question will belong to. Create an <b>Identifier</b> for the question</li>
            <li>Enter the question into the <b>Question Stem</b> field.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img class="shareWithMenu" src="../../Resources/Images/Assessment question types1/Associate Interaction.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="3">
            <li>Select <b>Associate Interaction</b> from the <b>Type</b> dropdown.</li>
            <li>Select either Correct/Incorrect or Per Distractor from the <b>Scoring Type</b> field. The first option scores the entire question, the second allows you to allocate different scores to different pairings.</li>
            <li>Set the minimum and a maximum number of pairs (associations) that the candidate can make in Min Associations and Max Associations. <br />If you leave these blank, enter 0 into both or set a maximum number greater than the minimum number then an Add Pair button will be visible to candidates. This button disappears when candidates have created the maximum number of pairs. It never disappears if you have left these fields blank or entered zero. <br />However, If Min Associations and Max Associations are equal and also greater than zero, candidates will see that number of empty pair boxes, with no visible Add Pair button. In the example below, candidates see three empty pair boxes and no Add Pair button. They must make 3 pairs before they can submit their response.</li>
        </ol>

        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="6">
            <li>Enter the <b>Source</b> items that the candidate will form into pairs. You can use Display order to sequence Source items for display to candidates. If the fields are left blank, the system will automatically shuffle the order.</li>
            <li>Either text or image can both be used as Source items. For text, type it in the text column; for images click in the text box then click the image icon to load an image.</li>
            <li>Set a minimum number of times the Source item can be put in a pair in Match Min. Candidates will not be able to submit their response until this minimum is reached. Set a maximum number of times the Source item can be paired in Match Max. Note that once the maximum has been reached, this Source item will disappear from the Source items displayed at the top of the candidate’s screen.</li>
            <li>Click and use the drop-down list to select the correctly matching Source item(s) in the Correct field. If desired, you can set multiple items that are all correctly matching pair items. Note that once you have specified a pairing for an item, you don’t have to enter the same pairing in the Correct field of its pair partner.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You can delete a Source row by clicking its minus icon at the right</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="10">
            <li>If you had set the Scoring Type field to Per Distractor (see 4.), you would also see a Scoring area where you enter scores for each correctly matched pair.</li>
            <li>Add Resources to the question if desired by clicking the arrow and following the instructions</li>
            <li>Select <b>Save Test Question</b>.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 class="Heading2">Preview</h2>
        <p>You can preview the question in the Test Player by selecting Preview from the Question header bar. </p>

        </p>
        <p>In this example, we specified that each item must be paired and it can only be correctly paired with one other item. Note also that a pair box will re-size as necessary to fit items dragged into it. </p>
