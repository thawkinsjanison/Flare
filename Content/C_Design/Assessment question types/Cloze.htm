        <h1 class="Heading1">Cloze</h1>
        <p>A Cloze question type asks candidates to fill in blanks in a passage of text. Depending on how the question has been set up, the candidate fills in blanks by selecting from a drop-down box and/or by entering text. There is no limit to the number of blanks that can be included in a passage of text.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Scoring</h2>
        <p>Cloze questions are scored as either right or wrong. If a candidate selects the correct option from the drop-down list or enters a correct value in the blank (as specified above) they get full marks. If they select a wrong option or enter an incorrect value, they get no marks at all.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Steps</h2>
        <p>Navigate to <b>Design &gt; Questions</b> and select <b>Add Test Question</b> from the <b>Actions</b> drop-down menu.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
            <li>Fill out the form details including the <b>Discipline</b> and <b>Module</b> you want the question to belong to. Create an <b>Identifier</b> for the question.</li>
            <li>Enter the question text in the <b>Question Stem</b> field. Insert one or more blanks. The blanks in the two possible formats are set up a little differently:</li>
        </ol>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 16pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Drop-down list: </li>
            <p>This is defined by a comma-separated word list contained inside square brackets [ ]. </p>
            <p>The correct answer/s are indicated by an asterisk * at the start of the correct word. The question is displayed to the candidate as a standard drop-down box. </p>
            <p>For example [left, right, *up, down] would appear as a dropdown menu showing ‘left’, ‘right’, ‘up’ and ‘down’ with ‘up’ as the correct answer.</p>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 16pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Text input: </li>
            <p>This is defined by a comma-separated word list contained inside curly brackets { }. </p>
            <p>All words contained in the list are accepted as correct. Case sensitive answers are indicated by an equals sign, i.e. =, at the start of the word. The question is displayed to the candidate as an empty text entry box. The maximum number of characters that can be entered in an empty box is equal to the length of the longest word contained in the list. </p>
            <p>For example {=Right, Left} would result in ‘Left’, ‘left’, or ‘Right’ being correct answers; however, ‘right’ would be incorrect.</p>
        </ul>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="3">
            <li>Select <b>Cloze</b> from the <b>Type</b> dropdown.</li>
            <li>Click the check box next to <b>Partial Scoring</b> if desired</li>
            <li>Add Resources to the question if desired by clicking the arrow and following the instructions</li>
            <li>Select <b>Save Test Question</b>.</li>
        </ol>
