        <h1 class="Heading1">Multiple Choices</h1>
        <p>A Multiple Choices Question type allows the author to specify multiple answers that can be correct. The options can be text (as in the example below) or pictures. This Question type is different from a Multiple Choice question, where there are multiple answers but only one can be correct. </p>
        <p>The standard presentation for a Multiple Choices Question is a list of options and checkboxes. Note that if Scoring Type is set to Correct/Incorrect (Point 5 below), the candidate must select all of the correct answers to be marked correct. If this is not desired, then set the Scoring Type to Per Distractor and adjust appropriately.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Scoring</h2>
        <p>This Question type is marked automatically. Score allocation is set by the author at the time of authoring.</p>
