        <h1 class="Heading1">Position Object Interaction</h1>
        <p>Position Object interaction asks candidates to drag an image to the correct position (hotspot) on another (larger) background image. Multiple images can be correctly dragged into positions by defining multiple hotspots. This question is similar to Graphic Gap match Interaction but it differs in that there is no indication of the hotspot locations, plus the dragged images do not ‘snap’ into place to reveal the hotspots.</p>
        <p>Notes: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>An image can be linked with more than one correct hotspot location. </li>
            <li>You can make this question more difficult for candidates by displaying images that can be dragged but do not have matching hotspots. Hence dragging them into a position doesn’t answer the question. </li>
            <li>Make sure that the size of a hotspot is big enough to fit the image that will be dragged onto it.</li>
            <li>When using images, it is best to check and adjust sizes before uploading, as re-setting height and width in the question may alter the image’s aspect ratio.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Scoring</h2>
        <p>This item type is marked automatically. Score allocation is set by the item author at the time of authoring. </p>
        <p>Each image/hotspot combination can be given a different score</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Steps</h2>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;;" start="1">
            <li>Select the <b>Discipline</b> and <b>Module</b> that the question will belong to. Create an <b>Identifier</b> for the question.</li>
            <li>Enter the question into the <b>Question Stem</b> field.</li>
            <li>Select <b>Position Object Interaction</b> from the <b>Type</b> field.</li>
            <li>Select either Correct/Incorrect or Per Distractor from the <b>Scoring Type</b> field. The first option scores the entire question, the second allows you to allocate scores to individual image/hot spot combinations</li>
        </ol>

        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="5">
            <li>Click the image icon to select image(s) from the available resources. This will be the background image. You can change the size of the image by entering new Width and Height values (but see Notes above).</li>
            <li>Hotspots are added by clicking the tool for a rectangular, circular or many-sided hotspot. For the first two you then drag out a shape, for the third you then click to add each vertex and click the first vertex again to close the shape. When no tool is selected the first two hotspot types can be dragged into new positions and proportions</li>
        </ol>

            <li>Each time you add a hotspot a new Destination line appears.</li>
            <li>In the Text column enter a name for the hotspot. Candidates will not see this. </li>
            <li>You can delete a hotspot altogether by clicking the red minus icon at the right.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Repeat steps 6-8 for each hotspot required</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="10">
            <li>Enter a Source item: click in the Image box then insert the resource.</li>
            <li>Set the minimum and maximum number of times that it can be matched with a hotspot in Min Choices and Max Choices. Candidates cannot submit their response until the minimum is reached. After the maximum number is reached the image disappears from the area above the background image, although existing images can still be repositioned. If Min Choices or Max Choices are left blank the functionality will be unregulated.</li>
            <li>Click and select the correct hotspot(s) from the from the drop-down box. </li>
            <li>You can delete a Source item altogether by clicking the red minus icon at the right.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Repeat steps 10-13 for each Source item.</p>

        <p>This will appear as:</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>In this example, the candidate has obviously placed the lungs in the wrong location and s/he can continue to drag further copies of it (but not the kidney) onto the image because of its Max Choices settings.</p>
