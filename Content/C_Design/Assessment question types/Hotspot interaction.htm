        <h1 class="Heading1">Hotspot interaction </h1>
        <p>A Hotspot Interaction question asks candidates to correctly select one or more areas (or hotspots) on an image. These hotspots are visible to the candidate and their labels also become visible when the candidate rolls over them. </p>
        <p>Note that Hotspots can overlap. The hotspot last on the list will be the one that is selected if the candidate clicks on the overlap. This could be used to award more points for a more accurate answer.</p>
        <p>The Select Point Interaction question type is similar to this question type, but it does not show where the hotspots are.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Scoring</h2>
        <p>This question is marked automatically.&#160; Score allocation is set at the time of question design.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Steps</h2>
        <p>Navigate to <b>Design &gt; Questions</b> and select <b>Add Test Question</b> from the <b>Actions</b> drop down menu.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
            <li>Fill out the form details including the <b>Discipline</b> and <b>Module</b> you want the question to belong to. Create an <b>Identifier</b> for the question.</li>
            <li>Enter the question into the <b>Question Stem</b> field.</li>
            <li>Select <b>Hotspot Interaction</b> from the <b>Question Stem</b> dropdown.</li>
            <li>Select either Correct/Incorrect or Per Distractor from the <b>Scoring Type</b> field. The first option scores the entire question, the second allows you to allocate different scores to different pairing</li>

        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="5">
            <li>Click the image icon to select image(s) from the available resources. This will be the optional background image.</li>
            <li>Hotspots are added by clicking the tool for a rectangular, circular or many-sided hotspot. For the first two you then drag out a shape, for the third you then click to add each vertex and click the first vertex again to close the shape. When no tool is selected the first two hotspot types can be dragged into new positions and proportions</li>

            <li>If a background image is selected (step 5) then two new fields appear. Max and Min choices can be used to set the minimum and maximum number of selections a candidate can make. Candidates cannot submit their response until Min Choices is met. If the fields are empty this will be unregulated.</li>
            <li>Each time you add a hotspot, a new line appears with required fields in red</li>
            <li>Enter a value in the Label column for the hotspot name</li>
            <li>Identify whether this hotspot is a correct answer by checking the box beside it in the Correct column</li>
