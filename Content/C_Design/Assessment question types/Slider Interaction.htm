        <h1 class="Heading1">Slider Interaction</h1>
        <p>A slider question requires candidates to choose a correct value by dragging a slider to the correct position. They can select a numerical value between lower and upper boundaries.</p>
        <p>This question type can optionally create defined numerical steps and also limit candidate responses to be between boundary values.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Scoring</h2>
        <p>This question type is marked automatically.&#160; Score allocation is set at the time of question design.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Steps</h2>
        <p>Navigate to Design &gt; Questions and select Add Test Question from the Actions dropdown menu.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
            <li>Fill out the form details including the Discipline and Module you want the question to belong to.&#160; Create an Identifier for the question.</li>
            <li>Enter the question into the Question Stem field.</li>
            <li>Select Slider Interaction from the Type field.</li>
        </ol>

        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="4">
            <li>Select the Orientation of the slider, either horizontal or vertical.</li>
            <li>Normally the lower bound is shown on the left or the bottom. If Reverse Orientation is checked the lower bound is on the right or top.</li>
            <li>Select either Correct/Incorrect or Per Distractor from the Scoring Type field. The first option scores the entire question, the second allows you to allocate scores to individual answers</li>
            <li>If Allow floating point numbers is checked then partial numbers (numbers that are not integers) can be a correct response. For example, 10.5.</li>
            <li>Set the number of Decimal Places required.</li>
            <li>In Lower Bound set the lowest possible response (inclusive).</li>
            <li>In Upper Bound set the highest possible response (inclusive). Of course it must be larger than the lower bound.</li>
            <li>In Step set the smallest increment that the slider control moves.&#160; For example if the step is 2, then the allowable responses are 0, 2, 4, (within the two bounds of 0 and 4). If not specified, then the step is 1 for non-floating point numbers, and continuous for floating point numbers.</li>
            <li>If Show Step Labels is checked candidates will see the step increments as a line.</li>
            <li>Correct Answer - Indicate the correct answer.</li>
            <li>Add Resources to the question if desired by clicking the arrow and following the instructions</li>
            <li>Select Save Test Question button.</li>
        </ol>
