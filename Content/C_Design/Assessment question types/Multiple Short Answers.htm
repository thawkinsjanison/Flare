        <h1 class="Heading1">Multiple Short Answers </h1>
        <p>A Multiple Short Answers question type combines several Short Answer questions in one question. Thus, candidates provide multiple answer responses within the same question. Each of the Short Answer question asks candidates to write an extended amount of text in their own words. This can be used for answers that vary from a single sentence to a full essay. The word count can be specified and certain actions can be set to occur when a word limit is reached.</p>
