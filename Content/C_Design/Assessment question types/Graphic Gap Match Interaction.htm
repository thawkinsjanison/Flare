        <h1 class="Heading1">Graphic Gap Match Interaction</h1>
        <p>A graphic gap match interaction question is based on an image containing a set of hotspot gaps. The candidate answers the question by dragging answers (images or text) from a set of options into the hotspot gaps. </p>
        <p>Note</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When using images, it is best to check and adjust sizes before uploading, as re-setting height and width within the question may alter the image’s height to width ratio.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Scoring</h2>
        <p>This question type is marked automatically.&#160; Score allocation is set by the author at the time of authoring.</p>

        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="6">
            <li>Click the image icon to select image(s) from the available resources. This will be the optional background image. You can change the size of the image by entering new Width and Height values (but see Note above).</li>
            <li>Hotspots are added by clicking the tool for a rectangular, circular or many-sided hotspot. For the first two you then drag out a shape, for the third you then click to add each vertex and click the first vertex again to close the shape. When no tool is selected the first two hotspot types can be dragged into new positions and proportions</li>
        </ol>

            <li>Each time you add a hotspot, eg the leaf hotspot below, a line appears in the Destination list with required fields marked in red</li>
            <li>In the Text column enter a name for the hotspot. Candidates will not see this.</li>
            <li>If desired enter the maximum number of matches (pairs) for the hotspot.</li>
            <li>You can delete a hotspot altogether by clicking the red minus icon at the right.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Repeat steps 8-11 for each hotspot required</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="12">
            <li>Enter a Source item. Either text or image can both be used. For text, type it in the text column; for images click in the text box then click the image icon to load an image.</li>
            <li>Set the maximum number of times that it can be matched with a hotspot</li>
            <li>Click and select the correct hotspot from the options available.</li>
            <li>You can delete a Source item altogether by clicking the red minus icon at the right.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Repeat steps 12-14 for each Source item. To add to the difficulty of a question you can add Source items that are not matched to any hotspot.</p>
