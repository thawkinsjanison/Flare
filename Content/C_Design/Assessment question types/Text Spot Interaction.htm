        <h1 class="Heading1">Text Spot Interaction</h1>
        <p>Text Spot Interaction question type asks a candidate to select one or more parts of a text. The author has specified the parts of the text that can be selected and which of those are correct answers. When displayed to the candidate, the potential answers are displayed as selectable buttons. There is also an option to make those buttons invisible, so that candidates don’t know where they are.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Scoring</h2>
        <p>This item type is marked automatically. Score allocation is set by the item author at the time of authoring.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Steps</h2>
        <p>Navigate to Design &gt; Questions and select Add Test Question from the Actions drop-down menu.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
            <li>Select the Discipline and Module that the question will belong to. Create an Identifier for the question</li>
            <li>Enter the question into the Question Stem field.</li>
            <li>Select Text Spot Interaction from the Type field.</li>
            <li>Select either Correct/Incorrect or Per Distractor from the Scoring Type field. The first option scores the entire question, the second allows you to allocate scores to individual hot text spots.</li>
            <li>Select either Visible or Hidden from the Spot Visibility field. This controls whether candidates can see that parts of the text have been made into text hotspots. Hidden hotspots will still be highlighted when clicked.</li>
