        <h1 class="Heading1">Multiple Choice</h1>
        <p>In a Multiple Choice Question type a candidate is asked to choose one answer from of a set of options. The options can be text (as in the example below) or pictures.</p>
        <p>This Question type is similar to Yes/No and True/False Question types in that there is only one answer a candidate can select and only one answer can be correct. In contrast, in a Multiple Choices Question more than one answer can be correct. </p>
        <p>The standard presentation for a Multiple Choice Question is a list of options with radio buttons.</p>
