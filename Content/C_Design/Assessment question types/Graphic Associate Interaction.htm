        <h1 class="Heading1">Graphic Associate Interaction</h1>
        <p>The Graphic Associate Interaction question type shows a background image with hotspots defined on it. The candidate creates pairs by dragging lines between the hotspots in order to associate them with each other. </p>
        <p>This is a powerful question type because one hotspot can be paired with multiple hotspots, leading to more complex assessments. Use this question type if the hotspots are related to the background image. Note that candidates can also pair items (images or texts) using the Associate Interaction question type, which does not have a background image.</p>
        <p>Notes: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>You use the settings in Min/Max Associations (see 8. below), Match Min/Max (see 8. below) and Correct (see 9. below) to set: the total numbers of pairs that candidates are permitted to create; the number of pairs that an individual hotspot can be in; and which of those multiple pairings are correct.</li>
            <li>Don’t make the hotspots too big relative to the background image, as large spots can make it difficult for candidates to draw/delete the connecting lines.</li>
            <li>Hotspots should not overlap as this makes it difficult for candidates to differentiate between them. The system will always snap a line to just one hotspot.</li>
            <li>When using images, it is best to check and adjust sizes before uploading, as re-setting height and width within the question may alter the image’s height to width ratio.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Scoring</h2>
        <p>This question type is marked automatically. Score allocation is set by the author at the time of authoring.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Steps</h2>
        <p>Navigate to <b>Design &gt; Questions</b> and select <b>Add Test Question</b> from the <b>Actions</b> drop-down menu.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
            <li>Select the <b>Discipline</b> and <b>Module</b> that the question will belong to. Create an <b>Identifier</b> for the question</li>
            <li>Enter the question into the <b>Question Stem</b> field.</li>
            <li>Select <b>Graphic Associate Interaction</b> from the <b>Type</b> dropdown.</li>
            <li>Select either Correct/Incorrect or Per Distractor from the <b>Scoring Type</b> field. The first option scores the entire question, the second allows you to allocate different scores to different pairs.</li>
        </ol>

        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="5">
            <li>Click the image icon to select image(s) from the available resources. This will be the optional background image. You can change the size of the image by entering new Width and Height values (but see Notes above).</li>
            <li>Hotspots are added by clicking the tool for a rectangular, circular or many-sided hotspot. For the first two you then drag out a shape, for the third you then click to add each vertex and click the first vertex again to close the shape. When no tool is selected the first two hotspot types can be dragged into new positions and proportions</li>
        </ol>
        <p>

        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="7">
            <li>Each time you add a hotspot, e.g. the circular hotspot over the labelled Oxygen picture below, a Source line appears with required fields marked in red</li>
            <li>The first time you add a hotspot the Max associations and Max associations fields also appear. Here you set the minimum and maximum number of associations (pairs) that a candidate may create. In general, the maximum will match the number of hotspots as this allows for the widest scope of answers. The system will also use this value if you do not enter anything in the field.</li>
            <li>In the Text column enter a name for the hotspot. Candidates will not see this.</li>
            <li>You must enter the maximum number of matches (pairs) for the hotspot. Optionally you can also enter a minimum number to force the candidate to match it to something before moving on.</li>
            <li>Select the other correctly matching hotspot(s) from the drop-down list in the Correct field. If desired, you can set multiple hotspots that are all correctly matching hotspots, as in this example for the Oxygen hotspot. Note that once you have specified a pairing for an item, you don’t have to enter this same pairing in the Correct field for its pair partner</li>
            <li>You can delete a hotspot altogether by clicking the red minus icon at the right.</li>
            <li>Repeat steps 6-7 and 9-11 for each hotspot required</li>
        </ol>

        <p>In this example, candidates can create 0-2 bonds from each atom and a total of 0-3 bonds in the whole question. Thus, they are given no indication that such bonds do exist in water, how many there are and where they are.</p>
        <p>For an easier question, candidates could for example, be limited to a minimum and maximum of 1 bond for each hydrogen atom. </p>
