        <p>Custom Page Modules are similar to Learning Modules in that pages are built in the Course Designer using panels. The difference between the two types is in the purpose of these pages. Learning pages are viewed in the Course Player for delivering learning or training. Custom Pages can be used to:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Insert pages into the <b>My Learning Dashboard</b> using <b>String Resources</b> or the <b>Pin to Dashboard</b> feature.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Make pages available in other places in the system using the <b>Menu</b> setting.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Make web pages available outside of the CLS using the <b>Allow Unauthenticated Access</b> feature.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A common use of a Custom Pages is to provide a welcome message or instructions on the landing page of the system. Like any web page, media such as video and images can be added to the page.</p>
