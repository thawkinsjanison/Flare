        <p>Modules are made up of Course pages. Panels are components of these pages and are designed to make the development of advanced content easy for developers without web development skills. The image below shows a page which is made up of 2 types of panels, on the left is a Plain Text panel and on the right is an Image panel. In the image panel the system has rounded the corners of the image and also sized it accordingly.</p>
        <p>There are 2 broad categories of panel types, learning panels and quiz panels.</p>
