        <h1 class="Heading1">Add a Page to a Learning Module</h1>
        <p>A Learning Module contains one or more Pages and each Page is linked to one or more Panels. When you create a Page, you set the number of Panels it can have and their layout on the screen by selecting a <strong>Content Template</strong>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Modules2/LearningPanelsOnly.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square; border-style: none;" />
        </p>
        <p>To add a Page to a Learning Module, select <strong>Design &gt; Modules  </strong>and locate the Module. Click its <strong>Pages</strong> link:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Modules2/AddPage.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that you can also click the <strong>Pages</strong> link on the Module's details screen.</p>
        <p>On the Module's pages screen, click <strong>New:</strong></p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Modules2/Add a Page to a Learning Page_1.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
            <li>Enter the page <strong>Title</strong> (this will appear at the top of the page in the Course Player) and click the <strong>tick</strong> icon. <br />The new Page's title will appear on the left hand side.</li>
            <li>The <strong>Title</strong> and <strong>Identifier</strong> fields will be automatically filled in on the right, but they can be edited.</li>
            <li>Click <strong>Select Thumbnail</strong> to insert an existing Resource image for the Page's thumbnail (47 x 22 pixels is ideal). This will be displayed on the top of the Course Player. You may need to upload another suitable image into the Resource collection.</li>
            <li>Select a <strong>Content Template</strong> from the drop-down box to specify the layout and number of Panels. </li>
            <p>The Templates are listed as percentages, for example 50+50 means that the Page is split vertically at the center into two equal (50%) Panel areas:</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/Modules2/Add a Page to a Learning Page_2.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
                <br />30 + 70 over 100 means that the Page is split horizontally, then the top half is split vertically with a 30:70 ratio:</p>
            <p>
                <img src="../../Resources/Images/Modules2/Add a Page to a Learning Page_3.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
            </p>
            <li>
                <strong>Save</strong> the page.</li>
            <li>You can see how the Page is going to look in the Course Player by clicking <strong>Preview</strong> at any time.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Modules2/Add a Page to a Learning Page_4.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>As you create more pages, you will see their titles listed on the left hand side. You can move a Page's position in the page order by dragging its title up or down in the list.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Modules2/Add a Page to a Learning Page_5.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>You can click a Page's title at any time to view and edit the Page's details, including the Content Template selected.</p>
        <p>Once Pages have been created they are ready to link to Panels. So the next step is to <a href="../../C_Design/Modules2/Add a Panel to a Page.htm">add Panels to the Page</a> to add content to the blank Panels you have just established.</p>
        <p>Note that if the Content Templates available for the Page do not meet your needs, you can create your own templates, see <a href="../../C_Design/Templates1/Add Content Layout Template.htm">Add Content Layout Template</a> for instructions.</p>
