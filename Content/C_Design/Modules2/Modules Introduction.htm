        <h1 class="Heading1">Modules – Introduction</h1>
        <p>There are 3 types of Modules:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
            <li><strong>Assessment</strong> - these are containers for assessment entities, including Tests, Surveys, Questions and Media Resources. Their primary purpose is to assess knowledge.</li>
            <li><strong>Learning</strong>- these are containers for learning content. They can also contain quizzes and surveys but the primary purpose is learning.</li>
            <li><strong>Custom Pages</strong> – these are very similar to Learning Modules but can be used in customised page layouts. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>This section of the Help site covers the 2nd and 3rd types of Modules, however the introduction below explains the three types of Module to help you understand the differences.</p>
        <p>The first type of Module, the <strong>Assessment</strong> Modules, are managed differently from the two other types of Modules because they are specialised for assessment. When candidates undergo assessment they are enrolled in a Catalogue Item that is linked to one or more Tests. Each Test is linked to one or more Questions. All of the Tests and Questions must belong to the same Assessment Module, which itself belongs to the same Discipline as they do. There are many types of Assessment Questions that can be created, see <a href="http://help.janison.com.au/Content/C_Design/Assessment%20question%20types/Creating%20Questions.htm"><span class="Hyperlink">Assessment Question types</span></a>.</p>
        <p>The diagram below shows these relationships:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Modules2/Modules Introduction.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square; border-style: none;" />
        </p>
        <p>Thus, you create an Assessment Module as a kind of shell, with Tests and Questions that belong to it and various settings, such as the Test Player’s skin. As the diagram shows, you do not link an Assessment Module to the Catalogue Item directly. </p>
        <p><strong>Learning</strong> Modules are structured differently. A learner enrols in a Catalogue Item that is linked to one or more Courses. Each Course is linked to one or more Learning Modules. And each Learning Module contains one or more Pages, with each Page composed of one or more Panels. All of these entities belong to the same Discipline. The diagram below shows these relationships:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Modules2/Modules Introduction_1.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;border-left-style: none;border-left-width: 1px;border-left-color: #a9a9a9;border-right-style: none;border-right-width: 1px;border-right-color: #a9a9a9;border-top-style: none;border-top-width: 1px;border-top-color: #a9a9a9;border-bottom-style: none;border-bottom-width: 1px;border-bottom-color: #a9a9a9;" />
        </p>
        <p>The diagram shows that the Pages, Panels, Tests and Questions are linked to the Learning Module and they also belong to it. It also shows that Panels can also be linked to Tests and Questions in order to make learning more interactive and reflective. A number of specialised Panels enable this and are linked to a smaller number of Question types, see <a href="../Panel Types for Tests/Test Panels in Learning Page.htm#_Test_Panels_in">Learning Question Types (Panels)</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Custom Pages </strong> Modules are almost the same as Learning Modules. However, Custom Pages Modules are not oriented towards inclusion in Courses. Extra options for their Pages mean that they can be linked to the <strong>My Learning Dashboard</strong> and <strong>Menus</strong>, as well as optionally viewed <em>outside</em> the CLS, see the document on <a href="../Custom Page Modules/Custom Page Modules Introduction.htm">Custom Pages Modules</a> for more details. </p>
        <p>To summarize this discussion of Modules: Assessment Modules are specialised for assessment and can contain a large range of Question types. Assessment Tests and Questions must be part of Assessment Modules. Learning Modules are specialised for learning but may also contain Learning Tests and Questions. The more limited range of Tests and Questions that are integrated in the Panels of Learning Module Pages are oriented towards enhancing the learning experience. Overall, these <em>belonging</em> relationships mean that Tests and Questions belong to only one Module and cannot be <em>directly</em> used in other Modules. If the Module is deleted, they are deleted too. </p>
        <p>Modules can be managed by selecting <strong>Design &gt; Modules</strong>.</p>
