        <h1 class="Heading1">Add a Panel to a Page</h1>
        <p>A Page is linked to one or more Panels. When you create a Page, you set the number of Panels it can have and their layout on the screen by selecting a <strong>Content Template</strong>.</p>
        <p>Each Panel also has its own <strong>Content template</strong>, including templates that allow it to link to a Test (and hence, Questions). The template specifies the kind of content that can be added or linked to the Panel.</p>
         <p>

        </p>
         <p>Panels make it possible for you to create different kinds of Pages without needing skills in HTML and CSS. Note that Panels belong the Learning Module itself and after creation, they can be linked to one or more Pages if desired.</p>
        <p>Broadly speaking, you can create two kinds of Panels in Learning Module Pages: those for learning content, see <a href="../../C_Design/Panel type/Course designer panels introduction.htm">Learning Panels</a>, and those for Tests and Quizzes, see <a href="../../C_Design/Panel Types for Tests/Test Panels in Learning Page.htm">Test Panels</a>.</p>
        <p>To add a Panel to a Page:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Select <strong>Design &gt; Modules,</strong> select the Module and click the <strong>Pages</strong> link. </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Either create a new Page and select a Content Template for its layout or click the name of an existing Page from the list at the left hand side.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Add a new Panel by clicking <strong>New</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Modules2/Add a Panel to a Page.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
            <li>Add a <strong>Title</strong> for the Panel. </li>
            <li>Select a <strong>Content Template</strong> from the drop-down list to specify the kind of Panel that you are creating. Depending on what you choose, there will be further information to enter. See <a href="../../C_Design/Panel type/Course designer panels introduction.htm">Learning Panels</a> and <a href="../../C_Design/Panel Types for Tests/Test Panels in Learning Page.htm">Test Panels</a> for the options and details required.</li>
            <li>Select <strong>Save and continue</strong> to save your work and keep you on the current Panel screen or click <strong>Save</strong> to return to the Page screen.</li>
            <li>Click <strong>Edit Template </strong>if you want to inspect the Template details.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Modules2/Add a Panel to a Page_1.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>After you have clicked <strong>Save</strong> and returned to the Page level, you will see the Panel you have created:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Modules2/Add a Panel to a Page_2.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>Other options now are:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
            <li>Click <strong>Edit</strong> to edit the Panel.</li>
            <li>Click <strong>Unlink</strong> to uncouple the linked Panel. It will not be deleted and will be available for selection throughout the Module.</li>
            <li>Click <strong>New</strong> to create up another Panel.</li>
            <li>Click <strong>Select</strong> to link to a Panel in this Module that you have already created.</li>
        </ol>
