        <h1 class="Heading1">Timing options</h1>
        <p>Timing options are provided to give a learner the freedom to decide when to complete a test. These are very useful when combined with Randomisation, Pass/Fail management and automatically marked Tests, because they simplify assessment delivery and reduce costs by allowing a candidate to complete the Test in their own time.</p>
        <p>Timing options at a Test level are set at the Test details screen and specify how long a learner has to complete the Test. Note any scheduling information must be configured at the Assessment Event level (see <a href="../../B_Manage Learning/Manage Learning Assets1/Add Learning Asset Assessment.htm?Highlight=assessment events">Assessment Events</a>).</p>
        <p>Timing settings can be overridden at the Assessment Event Level and for individual Test attempts.</p>
