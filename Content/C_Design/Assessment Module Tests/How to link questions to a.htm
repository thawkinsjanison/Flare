        <h1 class="Heading1">Link questions to a Test</h1>
        <p>On the <a href="../../C_Design/Assessment Module Tests/View test details.htm">Test details</a> page there are three ways to add Questions to the Test:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
            <li>Add a new Question from the <strong>Actions</strong> drop-down menu. This loads the New Test Question form page and has already filled out the Discipline and Module (which need to be the same as the Test's). For detailed instructions on how to create an Assessment Question, see <a href="../../C_Design/Assessment question types/Creating Questions.htm">Assessment Question Types</a>.</li>
            <li>Add a new Question by clicking the <strong>+</strong> icon on the <strong>Questions</strong> window. Again this loads the New Test Question form page and has already filled out the Discipline and Module. </li>
            <li>Link an existing Question using the <strong>pencil</strong> icon on the <strong>Questions</strong> window. It is possible to re-use Questions as long as they belong to the same Module. Click the pencil icon and a search menu will load. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assessment Module Tests/How to link questions to a.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="1">
            <li>Click or type a keyword into the search bar and click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
            <li>Scroll through the list of available questions. Select the <strong>+</strong> icon to add the Question to the Test. If you need to view it first you can click the <strong>eye</strong> icon.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assessment Module Tests/How to link questions to a_1.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />

        </p>
       
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;" start="3">
            <li>Once the Question has been linked and appears in the list of Questions in the Test, additional settings are available. 
                <p>The Question can be allocated a relative <strong>Weight</strong>. A weight of 0 means that answers to the Question are not part of the Section/Test&#39;s calculated mark.</p>
                <p>The Question can also be made <strong>Mandatory</strong> so that candiates cannot move to the next Section/Test until it has been answered. This is also relevant if you are offering students a <a href="../../C_Design/Assessment Module Tests/Randomisation.htm">random selection</a> of Questions from this Test. </p> 
            </li>
            <li>The icons at the right under <strong>Actions</strong> can be used to preview, edit, unlink or reposition the Question in the list.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assessment Module Tests/How to link questions to a_2.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>To complete the process, scroll down and click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>
        <p>Note that if you are adding Questions to a Section of a Test, you need to <a href="../../C_Design/Assessment Module Tests/View edit or add a section.htm">inspect the Section details</a> and locate the Questions window on the Section screen.</p>
