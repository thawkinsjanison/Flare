        <h1 class="Heading1">Inspect Test details</h1>
        <p>To inspect a Test's details navigate to <strong>Design &gt; Tests and Surveys</strong> and select the desired Test.</p>
        <p>Like all detail forms, the Tests and Surveys details form shows linked entities which are also clickable links. For Assessment Tests they might include linked Test Sections, Questions, Stimuli and Resources.</p>
        <p>The widget bar at the top allows acces to:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">

            <li style="list-style-type: disc;"><strong>Tag</strong> -Tests can be tagged as a way of categorising them. They can then be located through these Tags, see <a href="../../B_Manage Learning/Tags and Tag Types/Linking Tags to a Course Module.htm">Linking Tags</a>.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;"><strong>Administrators</strong> - this is used to set permissions against the particular Test, see <a href="../../D_Settings/Roles/Administrators Widget.htm">Administrators Widget</a>. </li>
            <p>You can view (upwards) all Users that have permissions over the Test, including their role and the scope of this role. Note that while it is possible to configure permissions for a Test here, this can lead to confusion. For example, granting permission to edit a Test, including adding and removing questions, does not allow editing of any Questions that belong to the Test because Questions have a different scope.  It may be more appropriate to manage permissions at the Module level, by selecting the Module that the Test and Questions belong to.</p>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;"><strong>Preview</strong> - this presents the Test in preview mode including Introductory Test Section sequences, see <a href="../../C_Design/Assessment Module Tests/Preview.htm">Preview a Test</a>.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;"><strong>Workflow</strong> - (if enabled) allows workflow management of the Test.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assessment Module Tests/View test details.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>A number of windows (collapsed by default) can be found at the bottom of the details form:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;"><strong>Timing Options </strong>- specifies the number of minutes available to the candidate for sitting the Test. This can be edited by clicking the <strong>pencil</strong> icon.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;"><strong>Player Skin Settings</strong> - sets the visual design of the Test Player, including colours and layout. This setting can be edited by opening the window and selecting from the drop-down menu. </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;"><strong>Questions </strong> or<strong> Sections</strong> – if the Test contains multiple Sections, the heading will be <strong>Sections</strong> and Test Sections can be viewed and edited by clicking this window. Options such as <a href="../../C_Design/Assessment Module Tests/Randomisation.htm">Randomisation</a> are found via a Test Section's details screen. </li>
                <p>If the Test does not contain multiple Sections, this heading will be <strong>Questions</strong> and the list of Questions linked to the Test can be viewed or edited by clicking to open the window. <a href="../../C_Design/Assessment Module Tests/Randomisation.htm">Randomisation options</a> are located at the top of the window.</p>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;"><strong>Response Analysis </strong>– this gives details about attempts taken on the Test.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;"><strong>Recent activities</strong> – displays any recent activity on the Test.</li>
        </ul>
