        <h1>Sequences</h1>
        <p>You may need to create a sequence of screens in a Test such that candidates see an introduction screen at the beginning and a screen at the end, that is different depending on whether they passed or failed.</p>
        <p>In a multi-section Test you can create this by creating a series of different types of <a href="../../C_Design/Assessment Module Tests/View edit or add a section.htm">Test Sections</a>, starting with one of type <em>Introduction</em>, and so on.</p>
        <p>When you create a Test that does not have multiple Test Sections, a <strong>Sequence</strong> collapsible window appears on the Test's details page.</p>
        <p>You click the pencil icon to open this window and enter the information to be shown to Test candidates at any of these three points in the sequence:</p>

            Click <strong>Save</strong> to complete the process.</p>
