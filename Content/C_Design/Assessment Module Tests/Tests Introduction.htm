        <p>In the CLS<strong> Tests</strong> are linked to <strong>Questions</strong> that belong to the same Module. Tests also include <strong>settings</strong> about how the Test is to be managed, e.g. how it is to be marked.</p>
        <p>Tests can belong to Learning Modules or to Assessment Modules. A Test linked to an Assessment Module supports more question types and has many more options, such as how it is timed, ordered and delivered. This document covers <strong>Assessment </strong>Module Tests.  Note that you can quickly create an enrollable Assessment Test using the <a href="../../B_Manage Learning/Add Learning/Step 3 Details for Test.htm">Add Learning wizard</a> which simplifies Test creation, slightly reduces the range of options available and creates a linked Catalogue Item. </p>
        <p>When you create a new Assessment Test you specify the Assessment Module that it belongs to. However, the Test must be directly linked to an enrollable Catalogue Item in order to be presented to the User in a <strong>Test Player</strong>; merely belonging to an Assessment Module will not present it in the Test Player.  The diagram below shows these relationships.</p>

        </p>
        <p>By default the Questions in a Test are organised into a single section. However, you can create a Test with multiple <strong>Test Sections</strong>. Each Test Section<strong> </strong>is linked to one or more Questions and plays a different role in Test delivery, for example a Test Section that is only seen if candidates are exiting a Test that they have failed.</p>

        <p>Note that the CLS caters for a wide range of uses: from a major Test development process involving teams of authors, editors and reviewers to a single Teacher with 25 minutes to create an automatically-marked quiz. To achieve this range of uses Test Designer settings are available under the Settings menu to customise how things work. Thus the functionality available in this section of the CLS is influenced by what has been selected in <strong>Settings &gt; Test Designer Settings</strong> and everything described here may not be visible on your screen.</p>
        <p>Note also that Tests and Surveys sit together in the left hand menu of the CLS, however they are quite different. A Survey is a tool used for gathering information and User feedback. Although it uses Questions, it differs from a Test as it is not assessable. Information about Surveys is at <a href="../../C_Design/Surveys/Surveys introduction.htm">Surveys</a>.</p>
        <p>To access Tests navigate to <strong>Design &gt; Tests and Surveys</strong>.</p>
