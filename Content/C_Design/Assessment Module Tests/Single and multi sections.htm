        <h1 class="Heading1">Test Sections</h1>
        <p>By default the Questions in a Test are organised into a single section and the term is not displayed. However, when you create a Test you can choose to have it divided into multiple Sections. Each Section contains one or more Questions. A Multi-Section Test if: the Test is rather long; covers a number of different topics; randomisation options need to be restricted to groups of Questions within the Test; or introduction and exit sequences are required for the Test.</p>
        <p>Single and a Multi-Section Tests appear differently in the Test details screen:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">A multi-section Test shows a list of <strong>Sections</strong> in a collapsible window. You inspect an individual Test Section's details in order to locate its Questions.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">A single section Test shows a list of <strong>Questions</strong> in a collapsible window. </li>
        </ul>
