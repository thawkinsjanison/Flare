        <h1 class="Heading1">View, edit or add a Test Section</h1>
        <p>When a Test is created you can choose to have it divided into multiple Test Sections, with each Section containing a number of Questions. These Test Sections can also play different roles in the Test Player. For example, you can start the Test with an introductory Test Section, follow this with Test Sections containing Questions and then present different Test Sections to the candidate when they exit the Test depending on whether they passed or failed.</p>
        <p>If you selected <em>Use Multiple Sections</em> when you created a Test, you will see the heading <strong>Sections</strong>, rather than <strong>Questions</strong>, in the Question's details screen.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Edit or view Test Section</h2>
        <p>To view and/or edit a Test Section go to the details screen for the Test, see <a href="../../C_Design/Assessment Module Tests/View test details.htm">details screen</a>. </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Scroll down and click <strong>Sections </strong> to open the collapsible window. Click the Section you want to edit. This takes you to the Test Section's details screen.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Click <strong>Edit Test Section</strong> if you want to edit them.</li>

        </p>
        <p>Sections contain the following information:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
            <li><strong>Name</strong> and <strong>Identifier</strong> (must be unique) - ensure this follows a naming convention.</li>
            <li><strong>Type</strong> is the type of Section. This determines the role that the Test Section plays in the Test Player and influences the types of Questions that can be linked to the test Section. There are several notable types:</li>
           
                <p><strong>Exit if failed</strong> - candidates will see this after they have exited and failed the Test.</p>
                <p><strong>Exit if passed</strong> - candidates will see this after they have exited and passed the Test.</p>
                <p><strong>Introduction</strong> - candidates will see this at the very beginning of the Test. You could use it to add a <em>Comment</em> Question Type containing instructions for the candidates. </p>
                <p><strong>Question</strong> - candidates answer Assessment Questions in this Test Section.</p>
                <p><strong>Survey</strong> - candidates answer Survey Questions in this Test Section.</p>
                <p>Note that the Type cannot be changed once the Section has been created. If you do need to change it, delete the Section, then create it and re-link the Questions. Note also that deleting a Section does not delete its linked Questions.</p>
        </ol>
