        <h1 class="Heading1">Using a Test</h1>
        <p>A Test is one of a number of Learning Assets in the CLS. Users cannot enrol in Learning Assets until they are enrolled in Catalogue Items, which typically happens at the end of the development cycle. Thus, Content Authors can work on Test development without needing to worry about exposing the content to Users before it is ready. </p>
        <p>A Test from an Assessment module can be made available for enrolment in the following ways:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Include it in a Program (multi-component Catalogue Item) which could also include other Learning Assets such as a survey, an Online Course, or a face to face workshop.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Create a Catalogue Item for the Test. This means that it will be possible to enrol students into this Test however there is no option to schedule a specific window of time during which the Test is available. This approach is suitable for small-scale or on-demand test delivery.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Create an Assessment Event linked to the Test. An Assessment Event is a scheduled instance of a Test, see <a href="../../B_Manage Learning/Manage Learning Assets1/Add Learning Asset Assessment.htm">Assessment Events</a>.</li>
        </ul>
