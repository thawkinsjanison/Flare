        <h1>Learning Module Tests Introduction</h1>
        <p>Learning Modules are specialised for learning and are oriented towards enhancing and monitoring the learning experience. Their tests have a limited number of Question types available and are designed to assist with learning as opposed to testing. This can be achieved in a number of ways, for example:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">If a learner gets a question incorrect, the system will allow the learner to retry until they select the correct response.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">If a learner gets a question incorrect, the system can provide feedback to the learner with the correct response or a clue to the correct response.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>NOTE: If you are not certain at this point if a Learning Module Test is the most appropriate test for your purpose please read our overview document on Tests.</p>
        <p>Questions are integrated in the Panels of Pages. For more information on this please visit our document on <a href="http://help.janison.com.au/Content/C_Design/Panel%20Types%20for%20Tests/Test%20Panels%20in%20Learning%20Page.htm"><span class="Hyperlink">Learning Module Questions (Panels).</span></a></p>
        <p>The questions are presented to the Users in the Course Player as shown below. The Course Player contains learning material as well as one or more tests.</p>

        <p>The settings for a Test in a Learning Module depend on the kind of Panel it will be linked to.
