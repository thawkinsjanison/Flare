        <h1 class="Heading1">Assessment Module Questions - Introduction</h1>
        <p>In the CLS, <strong>Questions</strong> are linked to <strong>Tests</strong>. There are two kinds of Modules that Tests and Questions can belong to: <strong>Learning</strong> Modules and <strong>Assessment</strong> Modules. The first kind of Module is oriented towards the learning experience; the second is oriented towards assessing that learning. Because of this, Tests and Questions are managed differently depending on the type of Module they belong to. </p>
        <p>Assessment Tests are described at <a href="../../C_Design/Assessment Module Tests/Tests Introduction.htm">Assessment Tests</a>. This document covers <strong>Assessment Questions</strong>.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The first step in creating a Question is to select the type of question you want to create. Many different kinds of Assessment Module Questions are available. Instructions for creating these are at <a href="../Assessment question types/Creating Questions.htm"><span class="Hyperlink">Assessment Question Types</span></a>. </p>
        <p>Once a Question has been created, its details screen is available. The screen displays the Question’s linked entities (Tests, etc) and all aspects of the Question. The screen allows you to view and edit linked Stimuli, Comments and Marking rubrics (where appropriate). It also shows you a Response Analysis of previous Test Attempts using this Question. In the widgets bar and depending on permissions, you can view and edit Tags, Administrators, Workflow states and Psychometric data. You can also preview the Question as it appears to a student.</p>
        <p>Note that the CLS caters for a wide range of uses: from a major Test development process involving teams of authors, editors and reviewers to a single Teacher with 25 minutes to create an automatic marked quiz. To achieve this range of uses Test Designer settings are available under the Settings menu to customise how things work. Thus the functionality available in this section of the CLS is determined by what has been selected in <strong>Settings &gt; Test Designer Settings</strong> and everything described here may not be visible on your screen.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Managing and Exporing Questions</h2>

        <p>A list of Questions is displayed with names, the type of question, its workflow state (if enabled) and date of last update. </p>
        <p>The list can be ordered by name or last update date by clicking the appropriate headings. </p>
