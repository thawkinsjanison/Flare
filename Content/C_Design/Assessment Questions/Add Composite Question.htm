        <h1 class="Heading1">Add Composite Question</h1>
        <p>A Composite Question is one that is composed of a number of Questions. They will all be displayed to students on one long screen. For example, a composite question might consist of a multiple choice question followed by an extended text question. Learners are required to complete all of the interactions within a composite question to be considered to have successfully answered the composite question.</p>
        <p>Scoring can be assigned for the composite question as a whole, or the individual interactions can be scored and marked separately. Score allocation is set at the time of authoring. Scoring Mode will only available if the multiple graded responses check box has been activated in the Test Designer Setting.
