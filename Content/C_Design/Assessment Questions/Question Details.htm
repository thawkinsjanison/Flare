        <h1 class="Heading1">Question Details</h1>
        <p>To inspect a Question’s details screen navigate to <strong>Design &gt; Questions</strong> and open the Question. </p>
        <p>You can use the <a href="Search for Questions.htm#_Search_for_Questions"><span class="Hyperlink">Search</span></a> feature to help find a Question.</p>
        <p>Once you have opened a Question, the top shows the name of the Module it belongs to and the type of Module it is. The name of the Module is a link which will open the Module.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Flag this</h2>
        <p>The Flag function can be used as part of a review process. Click <b>Flag This</b> to Flag the Question.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assessment Questions/Question Details_12.png" />
        </p>
        <p>The widget will change to indicate that it has been flagged. Hovering over the number makes a pop-up appear listing who has flagged it.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assessment Questions/Question Details_1.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>You can remove a Flag from a Question by clicking the <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assessment Questions/Question Details_15.png" /> button.</p>
        <p>Flagged Questions can be located using the <a href="Search for Questions.htm#_Search_for_Questions"><span class="Hyperlink">Search</span></a> bar and selecting from the options under <b>For me</b>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assessment Questions/Question Details_14.png" />
        </p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Widget bar</h2>
        <p>The widget bar allows you to view information and perform a number of actions. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assessment Questions/Question Details_2.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>The important components are:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
            <li><b>Tags</b>–Questions can be tagged as a way of categorising and locating them, see <a href="../../B_Manage Learning/Tags and Tag Types/Tags Introduction.htm">Linking Tags</a> for instructions on how to do this.</li>
            <li><b>Administrators</b>– this is used to set permissions over the Question. Click the widget to view Users who have various Roles over the Question and to edit this list.</li>
            <li><b>Preview</b>– click this to preview the Question to see how it would be displayed to Users in the Test Player.</li>
            <li><b>Workflow</b>– A workflow widget is only visible if workflow has been turned on in the test designer settings. Here authorised users can change the Question’s workflow status.</li>
            <li><b>Psychometric Data</b> – any metadata that has been collected and linked to a Question will display in a pop up box. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Immediately under the widget bar is a list of clickable links that show the relationships that this Question has with other entities in the CLS.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assessment Questions/Question Details_3.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>Basic information about the Question appears under the list of links.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assessment Questions/Question Details_4.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>Underneath the basic information are a number of sections that are collapsed by default.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Response</h2>
        <p>This shows the full details of the Question itself. It is the same as you would see if you created or edited the Question, however nothing can be edited here. </p>
        <p>Naturally the layout will depend on the type of Question involved. Below is an example of the Response section for a multiple choice question. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assessment Questions/Question Details_5.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Stimulus</h2>
        <p>If a stimulus had been added to a Question it can be viewed here. </p>
        <p>Click the <b>pencil</b> icon to make any edits.</p>
        <p>Click the + icon to create a new Stimulus and link it to the Question, see the document on <a href="../Stimuli/Stimuli introduction.htm"><span class="Hyperlink">Stimuli</span></a> for details about creating them.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assessment Questions/Question Details_6.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Comments</h2>
        <p>If this functionality has been turned on in the Test Designer Settings, comments can be added to the Question. They are available for others to view and reply to. Comments are a useful tool if workflow is enabled and Questions need to be studied and approved as part of a review process, particularly when there are multiple Users involved.</p>
        <p>Type a message in the blue text box. You can classify it by selecting an icon:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
            <li>General</li>
        </ol>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="2">
            <li>Question</li>
        </ol>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="3">
            <li>Support</li>
        </ol>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="4">
            <li>Challenge</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assessment Questions/Question Details_7.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>Add a file if required by clicking <b>Select files</b> and click <b>Post</b> to complete the process.</p>
        <p>Once a Comment has been posted the screen changes slightly. The Comment can be:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">edited by clicking the pencil icon.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">deleted by clicking on the red minus icon.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">hidden by removing the check mark next to <b>Post Visible</b>. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assessment Questions/Question Details_8.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Marking</h2>
        <p>This section only exists for Question types that cannot be automatically marked: short answer, multiple short answer and file upload question types. Appropriate Users must mark these Questions and need guidance on how to do this. The other Question types have the marking rubric established as part of the question and the CLS marks them automatically.</p>
        <p>This section contains two elements:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Text box for textual information about how the Question should be marked, i.e. qualitative information. </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Marking Scheme Components for the quantitative marking information, i.e. numerical values. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>A good example of the latter would be a Test Question set as an English essay. The marking scheme components would be the breakdown and score allocation for each aspect of the essay, e.g. spelling and grammar, structure, quotations etc. To complete this form:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Create an <b>Identifier</b> for each component.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Give the component a <b>Name</b>.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">A <b>Description</b> of the component can be added but is not mandatory.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Allocate a <b>Score</b> for the component. Check the box under <b>Half Marks</b> if you want to use decimal places when marking.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Click <b>Add</b> to save the component.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">The red minus icon will delete the component if needed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
