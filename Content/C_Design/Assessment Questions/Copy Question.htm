        <h1 class="Heading1">Copy Question</h1>
        <p>You can copy Questions. The copy will be placed in a different Module, which can also be in another Discipline if desired. </p>
        <p>Click <b>Copy Question</b> from the details page of the desired Question.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assessment Questions/Copy Question.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;max-width: 620px;" />
        </p>
        <p>Select the new <b>Discipline</b> and <b>Module</b> you want the copied Question to belong to:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assessment Questions/Copy Question_1.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>You may choose to modify some aspects of the Question in the copied version.</p>
        <p>Scroll down and select <b>Save Test Question</b>.</p>
        <p>A pop up warning box may appear advising you about Resources, Stimuli and Metadata depending on where you are moving the Question to. </p>
        <p>In the example shown below there are two messages in the box:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;" start="1">
            <li>Any changes subsequently made to the original Question will not be applied to the copied version of the Question (or vice versa). Similarly, if changes are made to the Stimului or Resources attached to the original Question this is not applied to the copied Question. </li>
            <li>If you move a Question to a different Discipline the metadata collected for the Question will not be copied.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assessment Questions/Copy Question_2.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>Click <b>Yes</b> or <b>No</b> to continue.</p>
        <p>Note that the Question will now <em>seem</em> to appear twice in the list of Questions. The copied version will have <em>copy</em> next to its name, as shown in the example below. Of course, as explained above the two Questions are now independent of each other and are two separate Questions with no ongoing relationship.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assessment Questions/Copy Question_3.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>You will now find that the newly copied question is available through the Discipline and/or Module that you copied it to. </p>
        <p>Note also that the newly copied Question has an extra section, Linked Items,  in its details screen showing its origins:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assessment Questions/Copy Question_4.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>The original Question has the copy noted under the <b>Recent activities</b> section.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assessment Questions/Copy Question_5.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
