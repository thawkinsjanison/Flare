        <h1 class="Heading1">Courses – Introduction</h1>
        <p>In the CLS there are a number of different types of <a href="../../B_Manage Learning/Manage Learning Assets1/Learning Assets introduction.htm">Learning Assets</a> such as Courses, Trackable Documents and Learning Events. Learners are enrolled in a Catalogue Item that is linked to one or more of these Learning Assets.</p>
        <p><strong>Courses</strong> are containers for learning content (text, images, video, etc) and they are created within the CLS. However, Courses are actually connected to the learning content through links to <a href="../Modules2/Modules Introduction.htm">Learning Modules</a> that are in the same Discipline. It is the Learning Modules that actually contain the <a href="../Modules2/Add a Page to a Learning Page.htm"><a href="../Modules2/Add a Page to a Learning Page.htm">Pages</a></a> (and <a href="../Panel type/Course designer panels introduction.htm">Panels</a>) that learners see in the <strong>Course Player</strong>. Panels can also be linked to Tests, Surveys and Questions that belong to the same Module. </p>
        <p>The diagram below shows these relationships.</p>
