            <h2>Internet Explorer 8 Announcement</h2>
            <p><a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ie/2014/08/07/stay-up-to-date-with-internet-explorer/" alt="Microsoft Developer Blog">Microsoft announced earlier this year that it was no longer supporting Internet Explorer 8.</a> Several major security risks have been identified within IE 8. Due to these security risks and the increasing difficulty of supporting new features and imporvements, Janison will no longer be supporting IE 8.</p>

            <h1><a name="new"></a>New Features</h1>
            <h2><a name="sub"></a><i class="fa fa-newspaper-o"></i> Subscriptions</h2>
            <p class="doclink"><a href="../B_Manage Learning/Subscriptions/Subscriptions Introduction.htm">Feature Documentation</a>
            </p>
            <p>Subscriptions is a new way to apply discounts on a suite of content. Using subscriptions, you are able to easily setup and manage discounted bundles of learning. Learners are able to purchase subscriptions which then give them discounted access to learning. Subscriptions are highly customizable and can be configured in a multitude of ways.</p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Release notes 1606/New Features.png" />
            <h2><a name="prog"></a><i class="fa fa-tasks"></i> New and Improved UI for Program Details view</h2>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Release notes 1606/New Features_1.png" />
            <p>Learners now have a much cleaner and more intuitive UI for enrolling and launching programs with multiple components. The new program template clearly displays your progress and status in each component of the program as well as extra details on each type of asset within the program. Contextual information is also provided based on the asset type of each component, for example, if a program contains a Learning Event you will be able to manage your session right from the program interface before enrolling.</p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Release notes 1606/New Features_2.png" />
            <p>The new program template is a 1-size-fits-all template and will be replacing the Default Vertical template as the default program style. As such, Janison will no longer be supporting the Default Vertical template as new features and adjustments are made to the CLS.</p>
            <p>To take advantage of the new program UI, clear the Template selection in the Edit Catalogue Item settings menu. This enables the new default template.</p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Release notes 1606/New Features_3.png" />
            <h2><a name="release"></a><i class="fa fa-compress"></i> Conditional Release of Program Components</h2>
            <!--<p>Feature Documentation</p>-->
            <p>With the new Conditional Release feature, you are able to set the access of a program component to allow or block access based on time and date rules. Using this feature you can now develop and customise in-depth programs which restrict access to certain components until a set date or time after enrolment. The same rules can also be applied to block a component after release.</p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Release notes 1606/New Features_4.png" />
            <h2><a name="nav"></a><i class="fa fa-bars"></i> New Left-hand Navigation Option for the Janison Course Player</h2>
            <p>Course Modules can now support left-hand navigation with the addition of the Nested Vertical Navigation Type. As well as providing a new look and feel to course modules, Nested Vertical also supports nested module pages. This makes it easier to read and navigate between nested pages within Course Modules.</p>
            <p>To set left-hand navigation use the Navigation Type selection within a Module’s settings.</p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Release notes 1606/New Features_5.png" />
            <h2><a name="auth"></a><i class="fa fa-user-secret"></i> New Authentication Mechanisms</h2>
            <!--<p>Configuration Guide</p>-->
            <p>Added support for the following Single Sign-On (SSO) mechanisms.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Facebook</li>
                <li>Google</li>
                <li>Office 365 (Azure AD)</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Release notes 1606/New Features_6.png" />
            <h1><a name="improv"></a>Improvements and Enhancements</h1>
            <h2><a name="plan"></a><i class="fa fa-bar-chart"></i> CPD Plan Enhancements</h2>
            <p>CPD Plans have received some enhancements which increase their functionality and provide Learners with more clarity on their progress.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Added support for Fractal Points which allow for point/hour requirements with decimals as opposed to only whole numbers.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Release notes 1606/New Features_7.png" />
            <ul>
                <li>Added Total Points to Learners CPD dashboard tile to provide a complete picture of CPD plan status.</li>
                <li>Improved Learner CPD dashboard tiles when displaying CPD plans with many tag category requirements.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2><a name="rep"></a><i class="fa fa-table"></i> CPD Reporting</h2>
            <p>Off the back of the CPD Plan Enhancements, we also added two new Customisable Reports for CPD to help managers better track and consolidate data on their team’s CPD memberships.</p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Release notes 1606/New Features_8.png" />
            <ul>
                <li>Added a Customisable Report CPD Details Report which shows a breakdown of CPD by tags.</li>
                <li>Added a Customisable Report CPD Summary Report which shows a breakdown of CPD Memberships for each user.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Included in the new CPD reports is an abundance of CPD reporting APIs which you can filter by in your Customisable Reports.</p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Release notes 1606/New Features_9.png" />
            <h2><a name="disc"></a><i class="fa fa-users"></i> Discussion Forum Enhancements</h2>
            <p class="doclink"><a href="../B_Manage Learning/Discussion Forum/Announcements.htm">Feature Documentation</a>
            </p>
            <p>Discussion forums can be configured as Announcements. Announcements act in the same way as forums do, however, only the discussion forum administrator is allowed to make posts on the Announcement.</p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Release notes 1606/New Features_10.png" />
            <p>Discussion Forum Settings were added to the Discussion Forum itself, allowing you to set different settings per forum.</p>
            <h2><a name="man"></a><i class="fa fa-book"></i> Learning Plan Enhancements for Managers</h2>
            <!--<p>Enhancement Documentation</p>-->
            <p>Added the ability for Managers to View and Comment on a learner’s Learning Plan. </p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Release notes 1606/New Features_11.png" />
            <h2><a name="rest"></a><i class="fa fa-unlock-alt"></i> New Catalogue Item Access Restriction Rules</h2>
            <!--<p>Feature Documentation</p>-->
            <p>Expanded catalogue item access restriction rules by adding the ability to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Restrict access to catalogue items after a period of time based on the due date.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Release notes 1606/New Features_12.png" />
            <ul>
                <li>Restrict access to catalogue items after a period of time based on the enrolment creation date.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Release notes 1606/New Features_13.png" />
            <h2><a name="dom"></a><i class="fa fa-link"></i> Subdomain Application URL Enhancement</h2>
            <!--<p>Feature Documentation</p>-->
            <p>Where originally Application URL could only be set to the Tenant level, within 1606 Application URL has been enhanced to accommodate Clients who use custom URLs for multiple Subtenants allowing you to set a unique URL for each Subtenant available to you. </p>
            <p>These settings can be found under Settings &gt; Email Settings.</p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Release notes 1606/New Features_14.png" />
            <h2><a name="enro"></a><i class="fa fa-balance-scale"></i> User Enrolment Rule Enhancements</h2>
            <!--<p>Feature Documentation</p>-->
            <p>We have made a number of improvements to User Enrolment Rules to increase performance and logging capabilities as well as expanding its functionality to encapsulate some of the cases in which clients were attempting to use User Enrolment Rules.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Added the ability to specify an absolute end date for a User Enrolment Rule. User Enrolment Rules will stop processing when the end date is reached.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Release notes 1606/New Features_15.png" />
            <ul>
                <li>Fixed a bug where Subdomain specific message templates weren’t being used correctly by the enrolment rule resulting in the wrong email message being sent to learners enrolled via User Enrolment Rules. User Enrolment Rules now support subdomain specific message templates for enrolment.</li>
                <li>Improved data logging for each User Enrolment Rule. All User Enrolment Rule run inputs are now visible via the Recent Activities section.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Release notes 1606/New Features_16.png" />
            <ul>
                <li>Improved performance of the scheduler’s handling of User Enrolment Rules so they are less likely to queue up or cause performance issue on the site.</li>
            </ul>
            <h1><a name="minor"></a>Minor Changes</h1>
            <h2><a name="eapi"></a><i class="fa fa-graduation-cap"></i> New Suite of Enrolment APIs</h2>
            <!--<p>Feature Documentation</p>-->

            <!--<p>Feature Documentation</p>-->
