        <h1>New Features and Enhancements for Release 1606</h1>
        <p><b>Note</b>: These changes will be taking place on the 29th of August 2016.</p>
        <h1 class="Heading1">New Features</h1>
        <h2 class="Heading2"><a href="../B_Manage Learning/Subscriptions/Subscriptions Introduction.htm">Subscriptions</a>
        </h2>
        <p>Feature Documentation</p>
        <p>Subscriptions is a new way to apply discounts on a suite of content. Using subscriptions, you are able to easily setup and manage discounted bundles of learning. Learners are able to purchase subscriptions which then give them discounted access to learning. Subscriptions are highly customizable and can be configured in a multitude of ways.</p>

        </p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">New and Improved UI for Program Details view</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Release notes 1606/New Features_1.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>Learners now have a much cleaner and more intuitive UI for enrolling and launching programs with multiple components. The new program template clearly displays your progress and status in each component of the program as well as extra details on each type of asset within the program. Contextual information is also provided based on the asset type of each component, for example, if a program contains a Learning Event you will be able to manage your session right from the program interface before enrolling.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Release notes 1606/New Features_2.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <p>The new program template is a 1-size-fits-all template and will be replacing the Default Vertical template as the default program style. As such, Janison will no longer be supporting the Default Vertical template as new features and adjustments are made to the CLS.</p>
        <p>To take advantage of the new program UI, clear the Template selection in the Edit Catalogue Item settings menu. This enables the new default template.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Release notes 1606/New Features_3.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Conditional Release of Program Components</h2>
        <p>Feature Documentation</p>
        <p>With the new Conditional Release feature, you are able to set the access of a program component to allow or block access based on time and date rules. Using this feature you can now develop and customise in-depth programs which restrict access to certain components until a set date or time after enrolment. The same rules can also be applied to block a component after release.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Release notes 1606/New Features_4.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />
        </p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">New Left-hand Navigation Option for the Janison Course Player</h2>
        <p>Course Modules can now support left-hand navigation with the addition of the Nested Vertical Navigation Type. As well as providing a new look and feel to course modules, Nested Vertical also supports nested module pages. This makes it easier to read and navigate between nested pages within Course Modules.</p>
        <p>To set left-hand navigation use the Navigation Type selection within a Module’s settings.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Release notes 1606/New Features_5.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;" />

        <h2 class="Heading2">New Authentication Mechanisms</h2>
