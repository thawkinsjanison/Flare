        <p>The People section of the system is more than just a list of all active Users.&#160; It is a place to go to connect with others that may be enrolled in the same Learning Assets, seek out experts for advice, link to discussion forums and report any inappropriate activity.</p>
        <p>To access People navigate to <strong>Manage People</strong> &gt; <strong>People</strong>.</p>
