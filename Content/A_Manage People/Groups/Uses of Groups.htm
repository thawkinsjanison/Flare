        <p>CLS Users are already organised by their membership in an Organisation and an Organisation Unit.  This follows a strict tree structure with two levels between the Tenant and the User. A User can only belong in one Org Unit in this hierarchy.</p>
        <p>
            <img class="shareWithMenu" src="../../Resources/Images/Groups1/Uses of Groups.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;border-left-style: none;border-left-width: 1px;border-left-color: #a9a9a9;border-right-style: none;border-right-width: 1px;border-right-color: #a9a9a9;border-top-style: none;border-top-width: 1px;border-top-color: #a9a9a9;border-bottom-style: none;border-bottom-width: 1px;border-bottom-color: #a9a9a9;" /> </p>
        <p>Groups offer additional and/or alternative methods for categorising cohorts of people because a User can belong to more than one Group and a Group does not have to be restricted to one Organisation or Organisation Unit.</p>
        <p>Broadly speaking, there are two main ways that Groups are used to collect cohorts of Users: </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li style="list-style-type: square;"><a href="#_Cohorts_that_transcend" class="Hyperlink">Create cohorts of Users that transcend Organisational structures</a>.</li>
            <p>Groups and Group Types can be created to collect Users into cohorts that are independent of an Organisational hierarchy.</p>
        </ul>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
            <li style="list-style-type: square;"><a href="#_Cohorts_that_extend" class="Hyperlink">Provide extra levels of hierarchy in an Organisational structure</a>.</li>
            <p>Groups and Group Types can be created to further categorise Users into cohorts within an Organisation Unit and hence create extra levels in an Organisational hierarchy.</p>
        </ul>
        <p>Note that in one Tenant you could have a number of Groups, with some Groups playing the first of these roles and other Groups playing the second.</p>
        <p>What can you do with these cohorts of Users? There a number of options:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">You can control the courses that Users see in the catalogue by setting up Catalogue Access Rules, see <b>Settings</b> &gt; <b>Catalogue Access Settings</b>.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Through Groups, Users can be enrolled in learning through:</li>
            <ul>
                <li style="list-style-type: disc;">The Assign Learning wizard. You can optionally specify that Users who join this Group after the wizard has been run will also be enrolled in the learning.</li>
                <li style="list-style-type: disc;">User enrolment Rules that automatically enrol selected Users in Catalogue items either when they register on the site or when a daily check is run. You can also specify that they be re-enrolled when the learning that they were previously enrolled in using this method is about to expire. Users are targeted using Filters (see below).</li>
                <li style="list-style-type: disc;">The Catalogue Item itself where there is an option to select Groups of Users to enrol. </li>
            </ul>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Users can be targeted through Groups and Group Types using <a href="../../D_Settings/Building Filters/Filters Introduction.htm"><span class="Hyperlink">F</span><span class="Hyperlink">ilters</span></a> which are used in a number of places in the CLS. Users can be targeted through their Group membership(s). Users are not members of a Group Type. However you can select the Group Type and are then shown all the Groups that belong to it. You can specify some or all of them. In this way (and depending on what plug-ins have been installed in your system) Cohorts of Users can be searched for, reported on using Customisable Reports, coupled to Competency Requirements and CPD Plans and have passwords regenerated or accounts activated in bulk.</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Groups work together with User Role(s). You can specify one or more Users who can administer a whole Group of Users and what they can do with them. Roles are specified in <strong>Settings &gt; Roles</strong>. Once a User is allocated a Role-linked permission over a Group, that User has the right to various appropriate activities, depending on the Role. For example, setting a User as a Marker of a Group will give that User access to <b>Manage Learning</b> &gt; <b>Marking</b> where s/he can mark any Test Attempts that the Group members produce. See <a href="../../D_Settings/Roles/Roles Introduction.htm">Roles</a> and <a href="../../D_Settings/Roles/Administrators Widget.htm">Administrators Widget</a> for further information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note also that when Users establish an account on the CLS (Self-Registration) this can be set up so that they also select their Group, for example joining age-limited Groups that (invisible to the User) are members of an <em>Age Range</em> Group Type.</p>
        <p>The two main ways that Groups organise User cohorts are described below.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="_Cohorts_that_transcend"></a>Cohorts that transcend Organisational structures</h2>
        <p>To understand this concept consider the strict tree structure that Organisations follow and the example of the tiny company discussed in <a href="../../A_Manage People/Organisations/Organisations and Groups.htm#_Oganisations_and_Groups.htm">Organisations</a> which follows the Organisations structure above.</p>
        <p>Remember that a User can only be in one place in the hierarchy. It can only belong to one Organisation Unit.</p>
        <p>In contrast, a Groups structure is capable of a more flexible structure because Users can be members of many Groups that are not necessarily aligned with their Organisation or Organisation Unit. </p>
        <p>Below we can see three Groups (orange) with their User members. This is overlaid on the Users’ Organisation structure. Note that one User can belong to more than one Group and that the Group memberships here cross Organisation Unit boundaries. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Groups1/Uses of Groups_1.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;border-left-style: none;border-left-width: 1px;border-left-color: #a9a9a9;border-right-style: none;border-right-width: 1px;border-right-color: #a9a9a9;border-top-style: none;border-top-width: 1px;border-top-color: #a9a9a9;border-bottom-style: none;border-bottom-width: 1px;border-bottom-color: #a9a9a9;" /> </p>
        <p>An example where this kind of structure might be useful is the appointment of Building Wardens for each building in an organisation. They are not necessarily aligned to the HR structure of the organisation. The Building Wardens are further divided into: </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Chief Wardens (white cap), </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Area Wardens (yellow cap) and </li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Fire Wardens (red cap). </li>
        </ul>
        <p>These groups cross boundaries: they are not limited to any particular place in the Organisations hierarchical structure. A participating User is a member of the <i>Building Wardens</i> Group Type as well as a member of, say, the <i>Red Cap</i> Group. This is shown in the portion of the structure shown below:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Groups1/Uses of Groups_2.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;border-left-style: none;border-left-width: 1px;border-left-color: #a9a9a9;border-right-style: none;border-right-width: 1px;border-right-color: #a9a9a9;border-top-style: none;border-top-width: 1px;border-top-color: #a9a9a9;border-bottom-style: none;border-bottom-width: 1px;border-bottom-color: #a9a9a9;" />
        </p>
        <p>
       These Groups and Group Types allow cohorts of people to be targeted. For example, appropriate training and Competency Requirements could be directed at all Building Wardens through the <i>Building Wardens</i> Group Type or fire safety material could be directed only at the members of the <i>Red Cap</i> Group. 
        </p>
        <h2 class="Heading2"><a name="_Cohorts_that_extend"></a>Cohorts that extend Organisational structures </h2>
        <p>To understand this concept, see <a href="../../A_Manage People/Organisations/Organisations and Groups.htm">Organisations and Groups</a>. In summary, this section discusses the scenario where an Organisational structure needs two more levels of HR organisation. The solution is provided by Groups and Group Types that create, in effect, two extra levels in the hierarchy (shown here in red and orange). Here each Group belongs to one Org Unit. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Groups1/Uses of Groups_3.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;border-left-style: none;border-left-width: 1px;border-left-color: #a9a9a9;border-right-style: none;border-right-width: 1px;border-right-color: #a9a9a9;border-top-style: none;border-top-width: 1px;border-top-color: #a9a9a9;border-bottom-style: none;border-bottom-width: 1px;border-bottom-color: #a9a9a9;" />
        </p>
        <p>It is worth repeating that there is no one fixed way to manage multi-level HR structures in the CLS. Another approach would be to create a new organisation structure with more than one Organisation in the Tenant. It all depends on what you want to be able to do with your cohorts of people and how you want to manage them. The CLS is flexible enough for you to design a configuration that best suits your organisation’s needs. You should discuss how to configure your implementation of the CLS with Janison and consider:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">How is the HR data of my organisation already set up?</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">What kinds of enrolling, reporting and management functionality do we want to implement?</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">What cohorts of people do we need to enrol, manage, assess, report on and/or require competencies/CPD of?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In summary, CLS Users are already organised by their membership in an Organisation and an Organisation Unit. Groups offer additional and/or alternative methods for categorising cohorts of people because a User can belong to more than one Group and a Group does not have to be restricted to one Organisation or Organisation Unit. Thus, multiple tree structures can be built using Groups to suit the people management requirements of particular organisations and/or to provide other layers of User management.</p>
