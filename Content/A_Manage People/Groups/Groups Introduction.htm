        <p>A Group is a collection of Users that are brought together for various purposes. A Group belongs to the Tenant although it can be restricted to a particular Organisation or Organisation Unit if desired. </p>

        <p>Group Types are collections of Groups. They can be used to categorise Groups.&#160; </p>
        <p>The diagram above shows the main Groups relationships; the dotted lines indicate an optional relationship. Note that Group Types belong to the tenant however for simplicity this is not indicated in the diagrams here.</p>
        <p>Groups allow cohorts of people to be defined and managed in various ways. CLS Users are already organised by their membership in an Organisation and an Organisation Unit. Groups provide complementary and/or alternative ways to organise and handle cohorts of Users, see <a href="../../A_Manage People/Groups/Uses of Groups.htm">Uses of Groups</a>. Users can be a members of multiple Groups, including Groups that are attached to a different Organisation Unit from their own. A list of all the Users in a Group is available through its details screen.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>The example above shows three Groups that are all members of one Group Type. Group 1 contains Users A and C. Group 2 contains Users B and D. Group 3 contains Users C, D, E and F.&#160; Users C and D are members of more than one Group. If you wanted to locate all of the Users in this example you could use the Group Type and then target the members of each Group that belongs to it.</p>
        <p>Groups are managed by selecting <b>Manage People</b> &gt; <b>Groups</b>.</p>
