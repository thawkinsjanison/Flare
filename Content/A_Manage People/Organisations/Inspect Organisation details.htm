        <p>Inspecting an Organisation’s details shows you the Identifier and Title of the Organisation as well as the number of Organisation Units, Users, Positions (if Position management is enabled) and Groups that are attached to it. These are also links to lists of those entities.</p>
        <p>To inspect an Organisation’s details navigate to <b>Manage Peopl</b>e &gt; <b>Organisations</b> locate the Organisation and click its Name.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Inspect the details as desired. </p>

        </p>
        <p>You can also click <b>Administrators</b> to add Users with various Roles over the Organisation. For example, depending on how the Roles are set up, making a User as a Marker will give her/him access to <b>Manage</b> <b>Learning</b> &gt; <b>Marking</b> where s/he can mark any Test Attempts that Users in this Organisation produce. Note that this Administrators widget allows authorised Users to add and remove administrators too.</p>
