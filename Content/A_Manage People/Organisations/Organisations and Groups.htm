        <h1 class="Heading1"><a name="_Oganisations_and_Groups"></a>Organisations and Groups</h1>
        <p>In the <a href="Organisations Introduction.htm#_Organisations_%E2%80%93_Introduction"><span class="Hyperlink">Introduction to Organisations</span></a> we saw that Organisation and Organisation Units are set up following a hierarchical structure known as a <i>strict tree structure</i>. Different kinds of more flexible hierarchical structures operate elsewhere in the CLS, such as with Groups. A User can belong to more than one Group and Groups are not necessarily tied to the Organisations structure.</p>
        <p>Groups are collections of Users and Group Types are collections of Groups, see Groups for more information. Groups can play an important role in the CLS by augmenting and/or bypassing the structure provided by Organisations. Using Groups, cohorts of people can be specified that cross HR boundaries, such as a group of Organisation-wide fire wardens. </p>
        <p>Another equally important role that Groups can play in the CLS is to augment the hierarchy provided by Organisations. Consider the situation where the tiny company described in the <a href="Organisations Introduction.htm#_Organisations_%E2%80%93_Introduction"><span class="Hyperlink">Introduction</span></a> grows in size and complexity. For example, it now has two separate factories with their own management and production sections, which has introduced two new levels to the company’s original HR structure:</p>
      
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Organisations1/Organisations and Groups.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;border-left-style: none;border-left-width: 1px;border-left-color: #a9a9a9;border-right-style: none;border-right-width: 1px;border-right-color: #a9a9a9;border-top-style: none;border-top-width: 1px;border-top-color: #a9a9a9;border-bottom-style: none;border-bottom-width: 1px;border-bottom-color: #a9a9a9;" />
        </p>
        <p>[The number of Users here is reduced for simplicity.]</p>
        <p>In the CLS the Organisations structure is two levels deep. To match this new HR structure we need to have four levels of organisation. We can create Groups and Group Types to create the extra levels in the hierarchy. </p>
        <p>In this example, <i>Coffs Harbour</i> could be a Group Type (in red) with <i>Coffs Harbour Production</i> and <i>Coffs Harbour Management</i> being Groups (in orange) that are members of this Group Type. Similarly <i>Singapore</i> would be a Group Type with <i>Singapore Production</i> and <i>Singapore Management</i> being Groups that are members of this Group Type. All four Groups contain Users, as shown below.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Organisations1/Organisations and Groups_1.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;border-left-style: none;border-left-width: 1px;border-left-color: #a9a9a9;border-right-style: none;border-right-width: 1px;border-right-color: #a9a9a9;border-top-style: none;border-top-width: 1px;border-top-color: #a9a9a9;border-bottom-style: none;border-bottom-width: 1px;border-bottom-color: #a9a9a9;" />
        </p>
        <p>The diagram below shows part of the company’s original Organisations hierarchy, which was seen in the <a href="Organisations Introduction.htm#_Organisations_%E2%80%93_Introduction"><span class="Hyperlink">Introduction</span></a>. The new Groups and Group Types hierarchy has been overlaid (in red and orange) on the Organisations hierarchy. The Groups are all linked to the Factory Org Unit. And all the factory staff in both locations are members of the same Factory Org Unit.</p>
        <p> <img src="../../Resources/Images/Organisations1/Organisations and Groups_2.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;border-left-style: none;border-left-width: 1px;border-left-color: #a9a9a9;border-right-style: none;border-right-width: 1px;border-right-color: #a9a9a9;border-top-style: none;border-top-width: 1px;border-top-color: #a9a9a9;border-bottom-style: none;border-bottom-width: 1px;border-bottom-color: #a9a9a9;" /></p>
        <p>Thus a Group/Group Type hierarchy offers a way to address cohorts of staff within one Org Unit through Group memberships. For example all the Singapore factory staff – both production and management – could be targeted through the Singapore Group Type. These staff don’t belong to the Group Type but they do belong to Groups that are linked to it and hence could be located via the Group Type. And factory management staff in both locations could be targeted through the Coffs Harbour Management and Singapore Management Groups.</p>
        <p>Thus, Groups can be used to add levels to an Organisations hierarchy or to create the cohorts of Users that bypass the Organisations hierarchy altogether. An example of the latter is a group of organisation-wide wardens described in more detail in <a href="../../A_Manage People/Groups/Uses of Groups.htm">Groups</a>. It is important to understand that there is no one fixed way to manage multi-level HR structures in the CLS. Another approach to the situation above would be to create a new organisation structure with more than one Organisation in the Tenant. It all depends on what you want to be able to do with your cohorts of people and how you want to manage them. The CLS is flexible enough for you to design a configuration that best suits your organisation’s needs. You should discuss how to configure your implementation of the CLS with Janison and consider:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">How is the HR data of my organisation already set up?</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">What kinds of enrolling, reporting and management functionality do we want to implement?</li>
            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">What cohorts of people do we need to enrol, manage, assess, report on and/or require competencies/CPD of?</li>
        </ul>
