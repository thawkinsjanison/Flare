        <h1 class="Heading2">Manage People</h1>
        <p>In this area you manage the people involved in the CLS: from learners and assessment candidates through to designers, markers and administrators. </p>
        <p>The <strong>Users</strong> section is where you create new Users and manage existing ones, including their current Enrolment(s). The <strong>People</strong> section is for connecting with other Users enrolled in the same Learning, linking to discussion forum contributions and reporting any inappropriate activity.</p>
        <p>All these people must be CLS Users and have <strong>Role</strong>(s) assigned to them which determine what they can see and do in the system. Users have one system Role and they may be allocated a number of additional Roles that give them rights over particular entities in the CLS. Users never see more functions than they need to use. For example, someone with the additional Marker Role can mark specific Tests or students but can’t change Courses and Enrolments or manage Users. In contrast, a User with a System Administrator Role can do and see absolutely everything. Roles are managed through <strong>Settings &gt; Roles</strong>.</p>
        <p>Every User is a member of an <strong>Organisation</strong>, an <strong>Organisation Unit</strong> and possibly one or more <strong>Groups</strong>. A User may also have a <strong>Position</strong>. Combining these functionalities makes it possible to model the HR structures of Health, Government, Education and Corporate organisations and to make it easier to manage and report on large numbers of Users. </p>
        <p>As shown in the diagram below, the top level CLS structure is the <strong>Tenant</strong>. Users belong firstly to an Organisation Unit, which belongs to an Organisation, which belongs to the Tenant. </p>

        </p>
        <p>As shown in the diagram below, this is part of a strict tree structure where a User can only belong to one Organisation Unit but s/he could be one of many Users that do so. This Organisation Unit can only belong to one Organisation but it could be one of many Organisation Units that do so. And the Organisation can only belong to the Tenant but it could be one of many Organisations that do so. </p>

        </p>
        <p>Groups offer an additional or even alternative method for categorising cohorts of people. A User can belong to more than one Group. A Group belongs to the Tenant but can be restricted to a particular Organisation or Organisation Unit. It is a member of a Group Type. Multiple tree structures can be built using Groups to suit the people management requirements of particular organisations and/or to provide another layer of User management, e.g. enrolling a Group of Users into a Catalogue Item or requiring a Group to acquire certain Competencies.</p>
        <p>A User may also have a Position, which belongs to an Organisation Unit. Positions enable reporting hierarchies such that a Position reports to another Position, not necessarily in the same Organisation Unit.</p>
        <p>The diagram below shows these structures, with optional relationships indicated by a dotted lines. The Group and Position connections for one example User are shown in grey:</p>
